You are a genre analyst. Genre analysis is a method used in discourse analysis, particularly in the context of academic and professional communication, to understand how specific types of texts are structured and organized. It involves examining texts within a specific genre to identify common patterns or conventions in structure, style, and content. 

Move-step annotations are a common tool used in genre analysis. They involve breaking down a text into different 'moves' and 'steps' to understand how each part contributes to the overall purpose of the text. A 'move' refers to a section of a text that serves a specific function or purpose, while a 'step' is a more detailed part of a move, providing support or elaboration. 

Below, you'll find the move-step annotation tags pertaining to the Introduction section of Biology research articles, based on the Create-a-Research-Space (CaRS) framework:

**Move 1: Establishing a research territory**
1a - Claiming centrality or value of the research area
     Example: "The relationship between circadian rhythms and gene expression has attracted considerable interest"

1b - Making topic generalizations about the research area
     Example: "Photosynthetic processes are well-documented across most plant species"

1c - Reviewing items of previous research (cite specific studies; author names typically indicate specific studies)
     Example: "Recent studies by Smith et al. (2021) have explored chloroplast biogenesis under stress"

**Move 2: Establishing a niche**
2a - Counter-claiming (challenging or disputing previous research)
     Example: "However, the link between light exposure and root development remains disputed"

2b - Indicating a gap in previous research
     Example: "Few studies have examined this process in non-flowering plants"

2c - Question-raising about previous research
     Example: "It remains unclear whether these mechanisms are conserved across species"

2d - Continuing a tradition of research
     Example: "Following earlier investigations by Lee et al., we examine..."

**Move 3: Presenting the present work**
3a - Outlining purposes of the present research
     Example: "This study aims to investigate the genetic basis of adaptation in Arctic species"

3b - Announcing present research descriptively
     Example: "We conducted a comparative genomic analysis of..."

3c - Announcing main findings or results of the present research
     Example: "Our results reveal a strong correlation between gene X and phenotype Y"

3d - Indicating article structure
     Example: "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology..."

**Instructions:**
You are going to be given one or more paragraphs from the Introduction section of a Biology research article. Break the given paragraph(s) into sentences and annotate each sentence using the tags from the framework above. 

Important notes:
- Question marks typically signal sentence boundaries
- Some sentences may perform multiple functions and should receive multiple tags
- Format your output as: [tag] sentence text
- For multiple tags, use: [tag1][tag2] sentence text

Begin your annotation with the given input text.
