You are a genre analyst. Genre analysis is a method used in discourse analysis, particularly in the context of academic and professional communication, to understand how specific types of texts are structured and organized. It involves examining texts within a specific genre to identify common patterns or conventions in structure, style, and content. 

Move-step annotations are a common tool used in genre analysis. They involve breaking down a text into different 'moves' and 'steps' to understand how each part contributes to the overall purpose of the text. A 'move' refers to a section of a text that serves a specific function or purpose, while a 'step' is a more detailed part of a move, providing support or elaboration. 

In genre analysis, it is common for analysts to use a combined tagging system to annotate texts, effectively capturing both the ‘move’ and ‘step’ within each segment of the text. This is typically represented in a format like ‘1b’, where ‘1’ denotes ‘Move 1’, indicating the primary functional segment of the text, and ‘b’ refers to ‘Step 1b’, which is a specific element or function within that move. This method of annotation provides a clear and structured way to identify and categorize the different parts of a text according to their purpose and function within the overall discourse. 

Below, you'll find the move-step annotation tags pertaining to the Introduction section of Biology research articles, based on the Create-a-Research-Space (CaRS) framework:

**Move 1: Establishing a research territory**
1a - Claiming centrality or value of the research area
     Example: "The relationship between circadian rhythms and gene expression has attracted considerable interest"

1b - Making topic generalizations about the research area
     Example: "Photosynthetic processes are well-documented across most plant species"

1c - Reviewing items of previous research (cite specific studies; author names typically indicate specific studies)
     Example: "Recent studies by Smith et al. (2021) have explored chloroplast biogenesis under stress"

**Move 2: Establishing a niche**
2a - Counter-claiming (challenging or disputing previous research)
     Example: "However, the link between light exposure and root development remains disputed"

2b - Indicating a gap in previous research
     Example: "Few studies have examined this process in non-flowering plants"

2c - Question-raising about previous research
     Example: "It remains unclear whether these mechanisms are conserved across species"

2d - Continuing a tradition of research
     Example: "Following earlier investigations by Lee et al., we examine..."

**Move 3: Presenting the present work**
3a - Outlining purposes of the present research
     Example: "This study aims to investigate the genetic basis of adaptation in Arctic species"

3b - Announcing present research descriptively
     Example: "We conducted a comparative genomic analysis of..."

3c - Announcing main findings or results of the present research
     Example: "Our results reveal a strong correlation between gene X and phenotype Y"

3d - Indicating article structure
     Example: "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology..."

**Instructions:**
You are going to be given one or more paragraphs from the Introduction section of a Biology research article. Break the given paragraph(s) into sentences and annotate each sentence using the tags from the framework above that describes the function of the sentence. Note that question marks could signal the boundary of sentences. Some sentences may perform multiple functions, sentences can only be assigned one tag, choose the single best.

Important notes:
- Question marks typically signal sentence boundaries
- Format your output as ONE tag and sentence per line
- Use EXACTLY this format: [tag] sentence text
- Do NOT add extra commentary, numbering, or explanation
- Begin each line with the tag(s) in square brackets

CRITICAL: You must annotate ALL sentences in the input text, in order.
- Go through the text sequentially from first sentence to last
- Do not skip any sentences
- Do not stop until you have annotated every sentence

You will start your annotation with the given input text.
