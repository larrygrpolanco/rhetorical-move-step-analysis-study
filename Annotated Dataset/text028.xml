        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Capturing conformational dynamics of protein-protein interactions is another grand challenge in structural biology, and many physics-based (computational) approaches have been used to tackle this challenge [2].</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>Computational tools have sampled the uncharted landscape of protein-protein interactions by emulating kinetic mechanisms such as conformer selection and induced-fit and by identifying energetically stable binding states.</text>

        <sentenceID>t028s007</sentenceID>
        <step>2c</step>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>In fact, AF-multimer (AFm) predicted accurate protein complexes in only 43% of cases in one recent study [1].</text>

        <text>Blind docking challenges prior to AF, particularly CASP13-CAPRI and CASP14-CAPRI experiments, reported high-quality predictions for only 8% targets [7,8].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s011</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>With the availability of AF and AFm, the CASP15-CAPRI experiment stood as its first blind assessment for prediction of protein complexes and higher-order assemblies [9].</text>

        <sentenceID>t028s012</sentenceID>

        <text>In this round, the docking community relied on AF and AFm for single-structure or complex predictions.</text>

        <text>Given that AlphaFold generates a static three-dimensional structure, it has been unclear whether conformational diversity could be captured by AlphaFold.</text>

        <step>2c</step>
        <text>In other terms, given a protein sequence, could AlphaFold generate ensembles of structures that include both unbound and bound conformations?</text>

        <step>3a</step>
        <text>To diversify model complexes generated with AlphaFold-multimer in the recent round of CASP15, predictors employed tuning parameters such as dropout [10], higher recycles on inference [11] or modulating the MSA inputs [12,13] with the amino acid sequence.</text>

        <sentenceID>t028s017</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>While these approaches demonstrated the ability to generate broader conformational ensembles, AFm performance still worsens with a higher degree of conformational flexibility between unbound and bound targets [1].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s018</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>Prediction accuracies especially deteriorated in bound complex regions involving loop motions, concerted motions between domains, rearrangement of secondary structures, or hinge-like domain motions, i.e., large-scale conformational changes, which are also challenging for conventional docking methods [14].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s020</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>This suggests a few interesting questions: (1) Do the residue-specific estimates from AF/AFm relate to potential metrics demonstrating conformational flexibility?</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s021</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>

        <sentenceID>t028s022</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>(3) Can we create a docking pipeline for in-silico complex structure prediction incorporating AFm to convert sequence to structure to docked complexes?</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Recent work in physics-based docking approaches tested induced-fit docking [2], large ensembles [15], and fast-fourier transforms with improved energy functions [16] to capture conformational changes and better dock protein structures.</text>

        <sentenceID>t028s024</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Coupling temperature replica exchange with induced-fit docking, ReplicaDock 2.02 achieved successful local docking predictions on 80% of rigid (unbound-to-bound root mean square deviation, RMSDUB &lt; 1.1Å) and 61% medium (1.1 ≤ RMSDUB &lt; 2.2 Å) targets in the Docking Benchmark 5.0 set [17].</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s025</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>However, like most state-of-the-art physics-based docking methods, ReplicaDock 2.0 performance was limited for highly flexible targets: 33% success rate on targets with RMSDUB ≥ 2.2 Å. Promisingly, by focusing backbone moves on known mobile residues (i.e., residues that exhibit conformational changes upon binding), ReplicaDock 2.0 sampling substantially improved the docking accuracy.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s026</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>But the flexible residues must first, somehow, be identified.</text>

        <sentenceID>t028s027</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Additionally, physics-based docking is quite slow (6-8 hrs on a 24-core CPU cluster) compared to recent DL based docking tools (0.1-10 minutes on a single NVIDIA GPU).</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s028</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>However, docking-specific DL tools such as EquiDock [18] and dMASIF [19] do not allow for protein flexibility, and recent tools like GeoDock [20], and DockGPT [21] have very limited backbone flexibility.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s029</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Further, all of these DL docking tools have low success rates on unbound docking targets such as those in Docking Benchmark 5.5 [20].</text>

        <text>In this work, we combine the features of a top deep learning approach (AlphaFold-multimer [4]) with physics-based docking schemes (ReplicaDock 2.02) to systematically dock protein interfaces.</text>

        <text>The overarching goal is to create a robust pipeline for easier, reproducible, and accurate modeling of protein complexes.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s032</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>We investigate the aforementioned questions and create a protocol to resolve AFm failures and capture binding-induced conformational changes.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s033</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>We first assess the utility of AFm confidence metrics to detect conformational flexibility and binding site confidence.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s034</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>Next, we feed these metrics and the AFm-generated structural template to ReplicaDock 2.0, creating a pipeline we call AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking).</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t028s035</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>We test AlphaRED’s docking accuracy on a curated set of benchmark targets of bound and unbound protein structures of varying levels of binding-induced conformational change, including antibody-antigen interfaces, which additionally challenge AF2m due to the lack of evolutionary information across the interface [22,23].</text>
