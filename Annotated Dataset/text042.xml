        <text>A rise in circulating catecholamine (CA) levels is a crucial step triggered by the organism to cope with a stressful situation.</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>By releasing both epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE), the adrenal medullary tissue crucially contributes to this response.</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>Beyond the beneficial effect of CA secretion elicited by an acute stress, sustained and/or repetitive CA secretion episodes (in response to chronic stressful situations for example) can have deleterious outcomes [1], as unveiled by the elevated blood pressure observed in response to chronic infusion of E in rat [2,3] or in chronically cold stressed rats [4].</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>It has long been reported that increased blood pressure is associated with a sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity leading to a raised neural tone [5,6] and increased plasma E and NE [7].</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The adrenal medulla being the unique source of circulating E, this assigns the secretory function of the medulla and more generally the sympatho-adrenal axis as critical determinants of arterial hypertension pathogenesis [8–10].</text>

        <step>2b</step>
        <text>Reciprocally, and despite it is indisputable that the adrenal medulla primarily contributes to enhance blood pressure, whether and how a ‘hypertensive’ environment impacts the adrenal secretory function itself remains elusive.</text>

        <step>3a</step>
        <text>We address this issue in the adult spontaneously hypertensive rat, in which the circulating E levels gradually increase as arterial hypertension develops and then stabilize in adult animals to become comparable to those in normotensive rats [11].</text>

        <text>gis suggests that the adrenal gland develops shielding mechanisms dedicated to normalize blood CA amounts, and to date nothing is known on the adaptive mechanisms elaborated by the neuroendocrine chromaffin cells to adjust the release of CA.</text>

        <text>Adrenal CA secretion and more generally the adrenomedullary tissue function are controlled by the coordination of interconnected and complex pathways [12].</text>

        <sentenceID>t042s010</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The initial incoming command comes from the sympathetic nervous system that releases mainly acetylcholine (ACh) but also neuropeptides (PACAP, VIP…) at splanchnic nerve terminals synapsing onto chromaffin cells [13,14].</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The resulting ACh-evoked chromaffin cell depolarization and subsequent cytosolic Ca2+ rise are key processes for CA exocytosis.</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>In addition and unraveled from studies in both acute adrenal slices and in vivo in anaesthetized rodents, the local communication mediated by gap junctions between chromaffin cells represents a functional route by which biological signals propagate between adjacent cells and subsequently contribute to CA release[15–20].</text>

        <text>To elucidate the feedback mechanisms elaborated by the adrenal medullary tissue to manage a chronic sustained elevated blood pressure, we investigated chromaffin cell stimulus-secretion coupling in acute adrenal slices of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and their parent age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats.</text>

        <text>By driving numerous cellular/tissular processes, chromaffin cell excitability is a major player in stimulus-secretion coupling.</text>

        <text>It relies on intricate mechanisms, not only supported by ion channels expressed at the plasma membrane, but also by the crosstalk between cholinergic and peptidergic innervation [21] and the gap junctional electrical coupling between chromaffin cells [17,19,20].</text>

        <sentenceID>t042s016</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>We identified relevant modifications in chromaffin cell excitability through changes in voltage-gated ion channel expression, cholinergic synaptic neurotransmission and gap junctional communication, that argue for a less efficient stimulus-secretion coupling in hypertensive animals, markedly observed upon robust challenges.</text>
