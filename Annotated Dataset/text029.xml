        <text>As observed in recent cyro-electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies, virions contain ≈38±10 ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) that condense the large viral genomic RNA (gRNA) like beads on a string (1, 2).</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>vRNPs have 14 -16 nm sized pillar-shaped structures, are heterogeneous, and are composed of nucleocapsid (N-)protein and RNA with unknown architecture and assembly pathway.</text>

        <text>N-protein is a 419 aa protein highly expressed in infected cells, and besides its key role in vRNP formation it is highly multifunctional (3–5).</text>

        <text>It consists in two folded domains, the NTD and CTD, which are linked and flanked by large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) termed N-arm, linker, and C-arm (6) (Figure 1A).</text>

        <sentenceID>t029s007</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The NTD forms a nucleic acid (NA) binding site that is thought to harbor recognition mechanism of a packaging signal (7).</text>

        <sentenceID>t029s008</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The CTD provides a high-affinity dimerization interface and also binds NA (6) (Figure 1B).</text>

        <sentenceID>t029s009</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Ultra-weak protein-protein interactions allow N-protein to undergo liquid- liquid phase separation (LLPS), enhanced in the presence of NA, to form droplets of high macromolecular density (8–11), which are thought to facilitate the assembly of vRNPs (9, 11–13).</text>

        <sentenceID>t029s010</sentenceID>

        <sentenceID>t029s011</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>For example, the N-arm undergoes conformational changes upon NA binding to NTD, significantly increasing the affinity of the NTD for RNA (15).</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Similar to the N-arm, an SR-rich portion of the linker IDR flanking the NTD is also perturbed by NA binding (14), as is an L-rich sequence of the linker IDR (LRS) further downstream.</text>

        <sentenceID>t029s013</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Recently, we have shown that highly conserved transient helices in the LRS can assemble cooperatively into coiled-coil trimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers, in a process that is allosterically enhanced by NA binding (17, 18) (Figure 1C).</text>

        <sentenceID>t029s014</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>We hypothesized that this mechanism might initiate assembly by providing additional protein-protein interfaces essential for stabilizing three-dimensional structures of the vRNPs (17, 18).</text>

        <text>To study the assembly mechanism in more detail we examine N-protein binding to short NA probes of sufficient length for multi-valent binding and ask how scaffolding N-protein might diminish or augment simultaneous LRS oligomerization.</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>As shown by Carlson and co-workers, mixtures of stem-loop RNA and N-protein form large RNA/protein complexes (RNPs) that may serve as a model for the viral vRNPs (11, 16).</text>

        <text>In the current study, to further elucidate the assembly mechanism we utilize this system and compare the size distribution and composition of complexes formed by wildtype N-protein (NWT) or mutants that abrogate LRS oligomerization binding either short linear oligonucleotides or stem-loop RNA.</text>
