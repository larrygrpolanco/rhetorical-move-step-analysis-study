        <text>A hallmark of cancer cells that distinguishes them from normal differentiated cells is their unrestricted proliferative ability.</text>

        <text>The former includes those that promote DNA and protein synthesis including PI3 kinase and Ras-MAPK signaling, chromosome segregation, and telomere extension just to name a few, whereas the latter acts as a brake for proliferation including the tumor suppressors PTEN and p53 [2, 3].</text>

        <text>Not surprisingly, hampering cancer proliferation is a primary target of cancer drugs, for example, paclitaxel (Taxol), the most prescribed drugs for treating cancers, acts by inhibiting microtubule assembly to prevent cell division [4].</text>

      <sentence>

        <sentenceID>t031s0009</sentenceID>
        <text>As a major ECM component, collagen composition regulates various steps of cancer progression including growth, invasion, and metastasis, partly through activation of its canonical receptor integrin to regulate cytoskeleton organization and cell motility [5–7].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0010</sentenceID>
        <text>Recently, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2), a non-typical collagen receptor that is dysregulated in various cancer types, has emerged as a key signaling molecule in carcinogenesis [8, 9].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0011</sentenceID>
        <text>Collagen binding to DDR2 activates its tyrosine kinase activity to initiate canonical pathways such as ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades [10–12].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0012</sentenceID>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0013</sentenceID>
        <text>Besides providing biochemical cues that elicit signaling in cancer cells, ECM components also establish the biomechanical environment that critically controls cancer progression [13, 14].</text>

        <text>Integrin-mediated mechanotransduction has been proposed to regulate ECM stiffness-dependent signaling pathways that play pivotal roles in cell growth, proliferation, and survival [16, 17].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0017</sentenceID>
        <text>High ECM stiffness has been reported to facilitate cancer metastasis by triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition [17, 18], promote cancer cell proliferation, and boost resistance to chemotherapy [19].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0018</sentenceID>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0019</sentenceID>

        <text>To systematically examine the effects of DDR2 signaling and substrate stiffness on cancer cells, in the present study, we performed RNA-seq analysis of a human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t031s0022</sentenceID>
        <text>Moreover, because SH-SY5Y cells could be differentiated into a dopaminergic neuronal lineage, SH-SY5Y cells have also been used to investigate cell biology of dopaminergic neurons and Parkinson’s disease [22].</text>
