        <text>Biomolecular condensates serve as important mechanisms for the hierarchical and vectorial organization of chemistry within cells.[1–7]</text>

        <step>1a</step>
        <text>They are non-stoichiometric assemblies of biomolecules that can form via spontaneous or driven processes and exhibit characteristics of phase separation and percolation [8–10].</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>The chemical environment and physicochemical conditions within condensates are distinct from their surroundings,[11–18] enabling cells to selectively partition biomolecules, prevent unwanted cross-talk and interference between various biochemical pathways, and buffer against chemical noise.</text>

        <text>In recent years, these condensates have gained significant prominence and attracted substantial research interest.</text>

        <sentenceID>t025s005</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>They have been found to primarily form through the involvement of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) [19–22]. </text>

        <sentenceID>t025s006</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Multivalent interactions involve the binding of multiple partners simultaneously and are often nonspecific in nature, leading to the spontaneous aggregation and condensationof various cellular components.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s007</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>These unique proteins lack a fixed threedimensional structure, enabling them to be highly flexible and engage in multivalent interactions.</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Many research groups have attempted to establish what is known as the “molecular grammar”,[23–34] which connects amino acid sequences with protein phase behaviors and the collective physical properties of condensates.</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The “stickers and spacers” model, originally developed within the context of polymer gelation theory,35–37 has gained popularity for modeling protein condensates [1,2,25,38–40]. </text>

        <sentenceID>t025s011</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>In this model, biomolecules within condensates are envisioned as possessing two distinct functional components: “stickers” and “spacers”.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s012</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Stickers represent specific molecular domains or motifs with a high affinity for one another, facilitating interaction and bringing molecules into close proximity, thereby contributing to the condensate’s cohesive and ordered structure.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s013</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Conversely, spacers act as flexible linkers connecting the stickers, enabling the dynamic and transient nature of interactions within the condensate.</text>

        <text>The simplicity of the stickers and spacers model, crucial for its theoretical elegance, encounters limitations when applied to realistic biomolecules.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s016</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Specifically, when dealing with an IDP, the identification of stickers and spacers is often challenging [1,3,42,43]. </text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s017</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Most amino acids undergo some level of interactions, and determining when to disregard these interactions to categorize them as spacers remains ambiguous.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s018</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>We propose that instead of entirely disregarding their interactions, it’s essential to consider the interactions between spacer sequences and explore their impact on the physical properties of condensates.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s019</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>This exploration could offer insights into the evolutionary pressure of IDP sequences, arising from the interplay between sticker and spacer sequences.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s020</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>Moreover, such an investigation could enhance our understanding of real-world biological condensates, where spacers might deviate from ideal behavior but still participate in weak interactions.</text>

        <sentenceID>t025s020</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>We expanded the stickers and spacers model to include explicit non-specific pairwise interactions between spacers, alongside the specific interactions among sticker motifs.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s021</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>This extension allowed us to systematically explore the intricate interplay between specific and non-specific interactions in determining the structural and compositional properties of condensates.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s022</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>Our investigation revealed that spacer interactions contribute to phase separation and the co-condensation of multiple molecules.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s023</sentenceID>
        <step>2a</step>
        <text>However, the non-specific nature of these interactions results in disorganized condensates with undefined molecular compositions.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s024</sentenceID>
        <step>2a</step>
        <text>In contrast, specific sticker-sticker interactions drive the formation of condensates with robust contacts and precise compositions.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s025</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>Subsequently, we discussed the implications of our theory for the evolution of protein sequences, asserting the existence of evolutionary constraints even on segments of protein sequences that interact non-specifically.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s026</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>These constraints ensure the functionality of condensates.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t025s027</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>This evolutionary pressure naturally favors the emergence of low complexity domains to suppress spurious interactions, facilitating the formation of biologically meaningful condensates.</text>
