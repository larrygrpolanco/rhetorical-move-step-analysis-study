        <text>Over the past 10 years, platelet thrombin receptors have been appealing targets for antiplatelet therapies, which led to the first-in-class FDA approved PAR1 inhibitor, vorapaxar.</text>

        <sentenceID>t041s014</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>First, targeting PAR4 signaling without inhibiting PAR1 allows platelets to continue to respond to low levels of thrombin and preserves normal hemostasis[12].</text>

        <sentenceID>t041s015</sentenceID>

        <sentenceID>t041s016</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Third, since the prolonged signaling mediated by PAR4 activation is associated with factor V release from α-granules and microparticle generation[16], selectively inhibiting PAR4 would not only prevent thrombus formation but also reduce platelet procoagulant activity[11].</text>

        <text>Natural sequence variants of PAR4 (e.g. rs773902 (PAR4-120A/T), and rs2227346 (PAR4-296F/V)) affect the receptor reactivity and subsequent platelet function [20–23].</text>
