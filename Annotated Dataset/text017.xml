        <text>The ambrosia beetle Cnestus mutilatus Blandford, 1894 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini) is native to Asia but was detected in the southern United States in 1999 (1, 2).</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>The species has since spread widely and quickly (3), utilizing a suite of adaptive traits: a wide range of host trees, haplodiploidy, inbreeding, sheltering in wood for most of their life cycle, sub-sociality, fungus gardening, and the ability to move from tropical to temperate climates (4–6).</text>

        <text>It is possible that C. mutilatus will not become a pest in its new geographic range.</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>Most ambrosia beetles take advantage of the weakened defenses of stressed or dying trees, in which they typically sow nonpathogenic fungi (7) that contribute to decomposition and nutrient recycling.</text>

        <text>However, timber- and tree-associated industries need to remain wary of their destructive potential.</text>

        <sentenceID>t017s006</sentenceID>
        <step>2b</step>
        <text>The woody tissues of dying and dead trees ferment residual sugars, producing several short-chain alcohols such as ethanol (8, 9).</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t017s007</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>A small proportion of these alcohols volatize (10) and attract the beetles, which will tunnel breeding galleries into the woody tissues.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t017s008</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Stressed nursery trees and many wood products also volatize alcohols, and holes from any resulting beetle galleries reduce the structural integrity, esthetics, and market value of these products.</text>

        <sentenceID>t017s009</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Examples include damage to wine or beer casks (8), overwatered or freeze-stressed nursery stock (11), recently felled timber (12), and freshly sawn lumber (13–15).</text>

        <sentenceID>t017s010</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Cnestus mutilatus has even been documented boring holes into the plastic walls of ethanol-gasoline containers (16).</text>

        <text>Ambrosia beetles could also cause ecological damage by seeding the spread of microbes, including their primary ambrosia fungus, secondary fungi, nematodes (17), mites, and bacteria (18).</text>

        <sentenceID>t017s012</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Fungi transported by ambrosia beetles can dramatically alter the natural progression of wood decomposition (19, 20) and could be phytopathogenic (21, 22).</text>

        <sentenceID>t017s013</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Geosmithia morbida (Ascomycota), the fungal pathogen that causes Thousand Cankers Disease in walnut trees (Juglans spp.), is known to be carried by C. mutilatus (23, 24).</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t017s014</sentenceID>
        <step>1a</step>
        <text>Given this potential for both economic and ecological damage, C. mutilatus merit close monitoring (25, 26).</text>

        <text>Traps for ambrosia beetles are typically baited with slow-release ethanol preparations.</text>

        <step>2c</step>
        <text>However, propan-2-ol (hereafter referred to as isopropanol), while being used in traps as a killing agent and preservative, seemed to attract C. mutilatus (personal observations).</text>

        <sentenceID>t017s017</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>There would be considerable advantages to having an inexpensive and easy-to-obtain chemical serve all three functions of attractant, killing agent, and preservative without the need for slow-release mechanisms.</text>

        <text>The purpose of this study was to gather experimental evidence that isopropanol can be used as such in traps for C. mutilatus.</text>
