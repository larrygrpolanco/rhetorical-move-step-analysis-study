        <text>However, with few notable exceptions, transcription factors are perceived as ‘undruggable’ due to their lack of any targetable catalytic sites [3], and the associated challenges of finding small molecules which can specifically bind to and inhibit the large, flat surfaces usually involved in binding other proteins or DNA [4–6].</text>

        <text>ARNT belongs to the basic Helix Loop Helix - Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors, named for their shared N-terminal DNA binding bHLH motif and two PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B) which all mediate binding the requisite DNA and protein components required for their function [7].</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t032s0007</sentenceID>
        <text>ARNT is a class II protein which serves as a ‘universal’ binding partner to several class I bHLH-PAS proteins, including the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-α), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), neuronal PAS proteins (NPAS), and single-minded proteins (SIM) [7].</text>

    <sentence>
      <sentenceID>t032s0010</sentenceID>
      <text>For the former, AHR regulates the vertebrate xenobiotic response pathway by its binding to a wide variety of small molecules, ranging from pollutants (e.g., [2,3,7,8] - tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, “dioxin”)) to dietary compounds [9–11].</text>

    <sentence>
      <sentenceID>t032s0011</sentenceID>
      <text>In the cytosol, inactivated AHR is bound to and stabilized by the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone and other auxiliary proteins [12,13].</text>

    <sentence>
      <sentenceID>t032s0012</sentenceID>
      <text>Ligand binding to the AHR PAS-B domain triggers a poorly-understood response which includes translocation of cytosolic AHR into the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with ARNT to form the functional heterodimeric transcription factor that binds to dioxin response elements (DREs) upstream of AHR-controlled genes and initiates their transcription [14].</text>

      <text>Under normoxia, the HIF-α subunits (HIF-1α, 2α, 3α) are rapidly degraded and inactivated through oxygen-dependent pathways; these controls are relieved under hypoxic conditions, letting the HIF-α subunits accumulate and dimerize with ARNT in the nucleus [17].</text>

        <text>These include a group of coactivators known as the coiled-coil coactivators (CCCs) [41,43–47], recruited via the ARNT PAS-B domain and thus establishing the ARNT PAS-B/coactivator interaction as a potential target for intervention [41,44,46].</text>

        <text>In addition, the coiled-coil protein coiled-coil coactivator (CoCoA) CCC protein has been proposed as a primary coactivator of the AHR/ARNT complex, and interacts with the bHLH-PAS regions of both proteins [45], suggesting that ARNT/CCC interactions could be a point of modulation for both HIF and AHR pathways.</text>

      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t032s0032</sentenceID>
        <text>While characterizing the binding sites of these ligands has been technically challenging, we recently reported an ARNT/KG-548 cocrystal structure, showing that KG-548 binds on the surface of ARNT PAS-B [49].</text>

        <text>We used three ligands, KG-548, KG-655, and KG-279, as proof-of-concept small molecules to showcase two ligand binding modes: one on the external side of the PAS β-sheet (consistent with our KG-548/ARNT crystal structure [49]) and an internal cavity previously seen by x-ray diffraction [48].</text>

      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t032s0037</sentenceID>
        <text>Notably these three compounds differentially preferred binding these sites, likely correlated to their sizes and chemical features.</text>

      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t032s0038</sentenceID>
        <text>We also used ensemble docking to determine potential binding poses of KG-655 and KG-279 in the internal cavity that satisfied NOE-based protein/ligand distances, showing marked distortion of the protein domain upon ligand binding.</text>

        <sentenceID>t032s0039</sentenceID>
        <text>Taken together, this study validates the previously-proposed surface binding site for KG-548 and provided the first direct evidence of ligands binding inside the ARNT PAS-B domain cavity, all of which will aid designing more potent ARNT PAS-B/coactivator inhibitors for functional studies.</text>
