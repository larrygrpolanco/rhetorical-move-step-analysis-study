# Fine-Tuning Guide: Step-by-Step Instructions

## Overview
This guide walks you through fine-tuning GPT-4 for rhetorical move-step annotation using OpenAI's web interface (recommended for first-time fine-tuning).

**Model**: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14  
**Training Data**: 30 articles (text021-text050)  
**Expected Time**: ~30-60 minutes for training  
**Expected Cost**: ~$10-20

---

## Phase 1: Prepare Training Data (Local - 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Setup
```bash
python verify_finetuning_setup.py
```

**Expected Output**: All checkmarks (âœ“)  
**If any âœ—**: Fix missing files before proceeding

### Step 2: Generate Training File
```bash
python prepare_finetuning_data.py
```

**This script will**:
- Load your system prompt (prompts/system_prompt.txt)
- Load all 30 training article pairs
- Format them in OpenAI's JSONL format
- Validate the format rigorously
- Save to `finetuning_data.jsonl`

**Expected Output**:
```
âœ“ Loaded system prompt (3,234 characters)
âœ“ Loaded text021
âœ“ Loaded text022
...
âœ“ Loaded text050
âœ“ Successfully loaded 30 article pairs
âœ“ Created 30 training examples
âœ“ All 30 examples validated successfully
âœ“ Saved 30 examples to: finetuning_data.jsonl

SUCCESS! Fine-tuning data is ready.
```

**Verify the output**:
1. Open `finetuning_data.jsonl` in a text editor
2. Check that it has exactly 30 lines (one per article)
3. Spot-check line 1: Should start with `{"messages":`
4. Each line should be valid JSON with 3 messages (system, user, assistant)

---

## Phase 2: Upload and Fine-Tune (OpenAI Web UI - 30-60 minutes)

### Step 3: Access OpenAI Fine-Tuning Dashboard

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/finetune
2. Log in to your OpenAI account
3. You should see the "Fine-tuning" page

### Step 4: Create a New Fine-Tuning Job

**Click "Create"** button (top right)

You'll see a form with several sections:

#### A. Training Data
1. **Click "Upload file"**
2. Select your `finetuning_data.jsonl` file
3. Wait for upload to complete (~10 seconds)
4. OpenAI will automatically validate the format
   - âœ“ Green checkmark = format is correct
   - âœ— Red X = format error (run the prep script again)

#### B. Model Selection
1. **Base model**: Select `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`
   - This is the only GPT-4 model available for fine-tuning as of 2025
   - DO NOT use gpt-3.5-turbo or other models

#### C. Hyperparameters (Leave as DEFAULT)
According to your study design, use OpenAI's defaults:
- âœ“ **Epochs**: Auto (typically 3-5)
- âœ“ **Batch size**: Auto  
- âœ“ **Learning rate multiplier**: Auto
- âœ“ **Validation split**: Auto (typically 10-20%)

**Why defaults?**
- Kim & Lu (2024) used defaults
- Matches your study design for reproducibility
- OpenAI's auto-tuning is generally optimal

#### D. Model Suffix (Optional but Recommended)
- Enter a descriptive name: `cars50-biology-30articles`
- This helps you identify the model later
- Final model ID will be: `ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:your-org:cars50-biology-30articles:xxxxx`

#### E. Validation File (Skip This)
- Leave blank - OpenAI will auto-split your training data

### Step 5: Start Fine-Tuning

1. Review the summary:
   - Training file: finetuning_data.jsonl (30 examples)
   - Base model: gpt-4.1-2025-04-14
   - Hyperparameters: Auto

2. **Click "Start fine-tuning"**

3. You'll see a confirmation with estimated cost
   - Expected: ~$10-20 for 30 examples
   - Click "Confirm"

### Step 6: Monitor Progress

**Training will go through these stages:**

1. **Validating files** (~30 seconds)
   - OpenAI checks your data format

2. **Queued** (~0-10 minutes)
   - Waiting for compute resources
   - Don't worry if this takes a few minutes

3. **Running** (~20-40 minutes)
   - Actual training happening
   - You'll see:
     - Current epoch (e.g., "Epoch 2/4")
     - Training loss (decreasing = good)
     - Validation loss (decreasing = good)
   - **You can close the browser** - training continues on OpenAI's servers

4. **Succeeded** 
   - Training complete!
   - Your model is ready to use

**What if it fails?**
- Check the error message
- Common issues:
  - Format error â†’ re-run prepare_finetuning_data.py
  - Insufficient credits â†’ add payment method
  - Invalid model selection â†’ use gpt-4.1-2025-04-14

### Step 7: Get Your Fine-Tuned Model ID

**Once training succeeds:**

1. Click on your completed fine-tuning job
2. Look for **"Fine-tuned model"**
3. Copy the full model ID
   - Format: `ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:your-org:cars50-biology-30articles:AbC123`
   - You'll need this for inference

4. **Save it somewhere safe** (you'll use it in the next step)

## Phase 3: Update Your Code (Local - 2 minutes)

### Step 8: Update llm_handler.py

Open `llm_handler.py` and find the `call_fine_tuned()` function.

**Before** (example placeholder):
```python
def call_fine_tuned(prompt, article_text, model_id):
    # model_id will be provided when calling this function
```

**After** (no changes needed in the function):
The function already accepts `model_id` as a parameter, so you're all set!

### Step 9: Test the Fine-Tuned Model

Create a simple test script:

```python
# test_finetuned.py
from llm_handler import call_fine_tuned
from pathlib import Path

# Load prompt
with open("prompts/system_prompt.txt", "r") as f:
    prompt = f.read()

# Load a test article (from validation or test set)
with open("gold_standard/CaRS-50/test/input/text001.txt", "r") as f:
    article = f.read()

# Your fine-tuned model ID (replace with yours!)
MODEL_ID = "ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:your-org:cars50-biology-30articles:AbC123"

# Test the model
response, model_name = call_fine_tuned(prompt, article, MODEL_ID)

print("Model:", model_name)
print("\nResponse preview:")
print(response[:500])
```

Run it:
```bash
python test_finetuned.py
```

**Expected**: Annotated output with tags like [1a], [1b], etc.

---

## Phase 4: Run Your Study (Following Your Study Design)

### Phase 2: Single-Run Evaluation

From your STUDY_DESIGN_FINAL.md:

```bash
# A4: Fine-tuned (1 run on test set)
python run_condition.py A4 --model-id "ft:gpt-4.1-2025-04-14:your-org:cars50-biology-30articles:AbC123"
```

### Phase 3: Consistency Analysis

```bash
# Run 30 times for consistency analysis
for i in {1..30}; do
    python run_condition.py A4 --run-number $i --model-id "YOUR_MODEL_ID"
done
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "File format invalid"
**Solution**: 
- Re-run `python prepare_finetuning_data.py`
- Check that output has exactly 30 lines
- Each line must be valid JSON

### Issue: "Model not available"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you selected `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14`
- Check OpenAI's status page for availability

### Issue: "Insufficient quota"
**Solution**: 
- Add payment method to your OpenAI account
- Check your usage limits at https://platform.openai.com/usage

### Issue: Training loss not decreasing
**Solution**: 
- This is rare with good data
- If loss plateaus after 1 epoch, your data might have issues
- Check a few examples in finetuning_data.jsonl manually

### Issue: Model is overfitting (training loss << validation loss)
**Solution**: 
- This might happen with only 30 examples
- It's OK for your study design
- Document in your paper's limitations section

## Notes for Your Paper (Methods Section)

**Fine-Tuning Configuration**:

> We fine-tuned GPT-4 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) using OpenAI's supervised fine-tuning API with 30 training articles from the CaRS-50 Biology subset. The fine-tuning process used OpenAI's default hyperparameters (auto-configured epochs, batch size, and learning rate multiplier), following the methodology established by Kim & Lu (2024). Training took approximately [XX] minutes and achieved a final training loss of [X.XX] and validation loss of [X.XX]. The same fine-tuned model checkpoint was used for all 30 consistency evaluation runs.

**Record for your paper**:
- Fine-tuning start time: ___________
- Fine-tuning end time: ___________
- Total epochs: ___________
- Final training loss: ___________
- Final validation loss: ___________
- Fine-tuned model ID: ___________

## Good luck! ðŸš€

Remember:
- âœ“ **First time fine-tuning is always a learning experience**
- âœ“ **The UI is your friend** (much easier than API for first time)
- âœ“ **Document everything** (model IDs, timestamps, losses)
- âœ“ **Test before full runs** (verify output format)
- âœ“ **Ask questions if stuck** (OpenAI support is responsive)

You've got this! Your preparation work has been excellent, and this is the final technical hurdle before you can run your actual study.
