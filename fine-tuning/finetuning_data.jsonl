role in orchestrating a multitude of genomic functions, including DNA replication (1) and the precise regulation of gene activity (2).\nIts structure exhibits a hierarchical organization, with biological function affected by structural changes across all levels of the hierarchy (3).\nThe fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, an assembly comprising of about 150 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer (4).\nNucleosomes are not simply barriers preventing access to genomic DNA; rather, they can be better understood as flexible platforms on top of which key biological processes can be organized (5).\nFor example, nucleosomal DNA sliding and unwrapping from histones modulate transcription factor (TF) binding (6–8), with downstream effects on gene expression.\nAt a higher hierarchical level, these nucleosomes interact together to form chromatin fibers exhibiting remarkable structural polymorphism (9–11).\nIn vivo, these fibers are predominantly disordered (12), but specific chromatin motifs are associated with distinct genomic regions, such as gene promoters or gene bodies (13).\nChromatin fibers further fold into topologically associated domains (TADs), contiguous regions with enriched physical contacts separated by insulator elements (14).\nThe pattern of TADs along the genome influences the communication between cis-regulatory elements (CREs) such as enhancers and promoters (15, 16).\nPointing to the intimate link between genome structure and function, genetic engineering has shown a correlation between the probability of enhancer-promoter contacts and gene expression levels (17), while transcription bursting dynamics was found to be linked with enhancer-promoter looping over time (18).\nDespite substantial progress in recent years, our understanding of the physical principles governing chromatin organization across different scales of genes remains limited, which hinders further exploration of the interplay between genomic structure and function.\nIn this work, we integrate in vivo experimental data into polymer models to explore the 3D structure of mammalian genes from the local chromatin fiber level to long-distance interactions between CREs.\nOur findings shed light on how this organization can contribute to gene regulatory functions.\nTheoretical approaches rooted in polymer physics have become increasingly important for complementing experiments and uncovering genomic structure-function relationships (19).\nSome of these approaches are data-driven (20–23), with interactions between genomic sites optimized to match the experimental Hi-C contact frequencies (24).\nOthers are centered around a key mechanism responsible for 3D genome organization, such as SMC-driven loop extrusion (25), protein-DNA bridging (26), or phase separation due to epigenetic modifications (27, 28).\nFurthermore, advances in the development of bottom-up molecular models of chromatin (29, 30), parametrized based on the physics of its biomolecular components, now offer a viable route to provide a mechanistic understanding of genes based on first principles (31).\nSuch models have revealed some of the molecular determinants of chromatin organization, including the role of nucleosome plasticity in mediating liquid-liquid phase separation (32).\nNotably, Tamar Schlick and co-workers utilized a nucleosome-resolution model to explore the structure of the HOXC gene locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (33), identifying the spontaneous formation of loops linking gene promoters with other regions of the locus.\nHowever, such physics-based chromatin models typically do not capture the effects of all the factors constituting the complex cellular environment, such as potential effects originating from TF binding (26, 34).\nDue to the practical consideration in modeling the behavior of several contributing molecular factors, physics-based models may not always accurately reproduce the experimental organization of chromatin in vivo, as determined from Hi-C or Micro-C contact probabilities (24, 35).\nTo address this limitation, Bayesian methods offer a framework to incorporate experimental observations into an existing physical model (36, 37).\nMetainference is one such Bayesian approach originally developed to integrate NMR data into all-atom force fields for protein molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (37).\nWe introduce and validate Hi-C metainference, an extension of the original approach to augment an existing prior model of chromatin to account for the observed in vivo contact probabilities of a target locus (from Hi-C (24), Micro-C (35), or other related approaches (13)), allowing one to characterize its 3D organization by MD simulations.\nAs priors, we employ two distinct bottom-up coarse-grained models of chromatin: the 1CPN model (30) at nucleosome resolution, previously parametrized from near-atomistic nucleosome simulations (38), and a chromatin polymer model at 1kb resolution newly parametrized from extensive 1CPN simulations.\nTherefore, our exploration of the 3D genome organization can be regarded as a 2-way process where the bottom-up prior is adjusted in a top-down fashion by integrating the experimental contact frequencies, retaining the advantages of both physics-based and data-driven approaches.\nIn this study, we integrate Micro-C data (39) into our chromatin models and investigate the organization of the Sox2, Pou5f1, and Nanog genomic loci in mESCs.\nFirst, our simulations show that in vivo genes adopt relatively compact conformations, with the same size scaling of a crumpled globule (40), while at the same time displaying significant structural heterogeneity and fast dynamics.\nUsing a nucleosome-resolution prior chromatin model for a section of the Nanog locus, we find that the local organization of the chromatin fiber is highly dependent on the underlying epigenetic marks, being open at CREs and more compact elsewhere.\nFinally, we demonstrate that transient, direct contacts between the Nanog promoter and its nearest enhancer are driven by the condensation of the chromatin

recently, a beta-barrel scramblase, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), was identified[7].\n[1c] The VDAC barrel has membrane-facing polar residues that, when paired with the same residues in a second beta barrel at a dimer interface, create a local membrane defect along which lipids cross the membrane in credit card mode.\n[1a] Therefore, the presence or ability to form a hydrophilic groove across the membrane seems to be a common feature for lipid scrambling.\n[1c] Insertases assist in the integration of membrane proteins into lipid bilayers[8].\n[1a] Their activity is necessary because membrane proteins typically have hydrophilic segments that do not spontaneously insert into the membrane.\n[1b] The translocating moieties of these proteins are thus amphiphilic, similar to lipids, and it is interesting to consider whether insertases and scramblases may share a common mechanism even though lipids and their polar headgroups are generally smaller than the translocating parts of membrane proteins.\n[1b] In fact, it has been suggested that scramblases, insertases, and some translocases may facilitate the insertion and translocation of phospholipids and proteins through membrane thinning[9].\n[1c] Recent work demonstrated that the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2 is an insertase[10].\n[3a] MTCH2 has a wide transbilayer groove lined with polar and charged residues, reminiscent of the hydrophilic grooves of scramblases, leading us to hypothesize that it may function as a scramblase.\n[3a] To test this hypothesis, we performed coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MTCH2 in a model lipid bilayer.\n[3b] We show that MTCH2 is indeed a scramblase, with the hydrophilic groove providing a transbilayer path for the movement of lipid headgroups while the acyl chains move through the hydrophobic interior of the membrane in credit card mode."}]}

Dutzler et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2010; Chavan et al., 2020; Schrecker et al., 2020) (Figure 1A), which contribute to the Cl-/H+ exchange mechanism (Accardi and Miller, 2004; Feng et al., 2012; Chavan et al., 2020; Leisle et al., 2020).\nDue to the small number of CLC channel structures relative to transporters, characterization of the central role for the Egate residue in CLC channels has primarily relied on extensive functional studies of channel gating rather than observed Egate side chain conformations (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018).\nThe first CLC channel structure reported was of bovine CLC-K (Park et al., 2017), a kidney-expressed homolog that is the lone CLC homolog lacking the Egate (Kieferle et al., 1994).\nThe only other CLC channel structures reported prior to 2023 are of the human CLC-1: one of these cryoEM structures shows Egate in the “out” position (Park and MacKinnon, 2018) while the other lacked density for Egate (Wang et al., 2019).\nThe Egate “out” position was originally posited to be exclusive to the CLC channel homologs, as its positioning off to the side widens the Cl--permeation pathway and, in CLC-1, results in a continuous pathway (Park and MacKinnon, 2018).\nSuch a continuous pathway precludes exchange coupling (Jardetzky, 1966; Miller, 2021).\nThe open Cl--permeation pathway in the CLC-1 structure is consistent with the known functional properties of CLC-1 in the absence of an applied transmembrane voltage.\nCLC-1 is a voltage-gated channel that is predominantly in the open state at zero mV (Altamura et al., 2020) (Figure 1B).\nAt negative transmembrane voltages that favor CLC-1 closing, the Egate sidechain presumably moves to either the “middle” or “down” positions, or both, to occlude the channel pore.\nCLC-2, like CLC-1, is a voltage-gated channel, but with opposite voltage dependence, opening instead of closing in response to hyperpolarization (Thiemann et al., 1992; Wang et al., 2017).\nCLC-2 chloride channels are expressed in every mammalian organ, where they play diverse physiological functions (Thiemann et al., 1992; Lein et al., 2007; Duan, 2013; Stolting et al., 2014; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018).\nPerturbation of CLC-2 function is associated with human disease including leukodystrophies (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), blindness (Xu et al., 2023), primary aldosteronism (Fernandes-Rosa et al., 2018; Scholl et al., 2018), and atrial fibrillation (Hansen et al., 2020).\nDespite their importance in human physiology, our understanding of CLC-2 molecular and physiological mechanisms is incomplete.\nA mystery concerning CLC-2 is why electrophysiological recordings of natively expressed channels reveal tremendous variation in voltage-dependent gating.\nCLC-2 currents are typically inwardly rectifying and activated by hyperpolarization, but the kinetics and degree of rectification are highly variable (Bosl et al., 2001; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018).\nIn some cases, this variability is understood – for example interactions between CLC-2 and the astrocytic GlialCAM protein yields voltage-independent currents (Jeworutzki et al., 2012; Maduke and Reimer, 2012).\nYet many questions about CLC-2 gating remain.\nLike CLC-1, CLC-2 gating depends critically on Egate (Niemeyer et al., 2003; Cederholm et al., 2010).\nAt zero mV, CLC-2 is predominantly in the closed state (Stolting et al., 2013; Stolting et al., 2014; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), presumably with Egate blocking the pore.\nSuch pore localization for Egate was modeled in a recent CLC-2 cryoEM structure (Ma et al., 2023); however, experimental density for the sidechain was lacking, and therefore the precise structure of this gate remains uncertain (Figure 1B).\nStructures with improved resolution will be crucial to understanding CLC-2 gating, which involves interactions between Egate, Cl- and H+, with differential effects of external vs internal ions (Pusch et al., 1999; Niemeyer et al., 2003; Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2010; Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2012; De Jesus-Perez et al., 2016).\nIn addition to the Egate mechanism, a “ball-and-chain” gating mechanism, in which the tethered N-terminus blocks the pore, has been proposed for CLC-2 (Grunder et al., 1992).\nHowever, this idea has been controversial (Varela et al., 2002) and the mechanism by which mutations in the N-terminal domain influence gating remains unknown.\nBecause a structural foundation for understanding CLC-2 gating has been lacking, we determined cryoEM structures of CLC-2, in the presence and absence of the selective inhibitor AK-42 (Koster et al., 2020).\nThe structures and complementary electrophysiology data presented here provide atomic insight into an N-terminal hairpin gating mechanism for CLC-2 channels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[1a] Ion transport across the cell membrane establishes and exploits ion gradients to store energy and regulate electrical signaling.\n[1b] Ion transport is catalyzed by two classes of membrane proteins: ion channels and active transporters.\n[1b] The CLC “Chloride Channel” family encompasses both major ion-transport mechanisms: half of the CLC homologs are electrodiffusive chloride (Cl-) channels, and half are secondary active transporters that stoichiometrically exchange Cl- for protons (H+) (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018).\n[1c] The occurrence of two mechanisms in one family suggests they operate by variations on a common theme (Miller, 2006), and experimental results revealed that CLC channels are “broken” transporters (Lisal and Maduke, 2008).\n[1c] In both CLC channels and transporters, a conserved glutamate residue referred to as the “gating glutamate” (Egate) plays a central mechanistic role.\n[1c] High resolution CLC transporter structures show that this residue can adopt four different conformations (Dutzler et al., 2002;

Jentsch and Pusch, 2018).\n[1c] Perturbation of CLC-2 function is associated with human disease including leukodystrophies (Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), blindness (Xu et al., 2023), primary aldosteronism (Fernandes-Rosa et al., 2018; Scholl et al., 2018), and atrial fibrillation (Hansen et al., 2020).\n[2b] Despite their importance in human physiology, our understanding of CLC-2 molecular and physiological mechanisms is incomplete.\n[2c] A mystery concerning CLC-2 is why electrophysiological recordings of natively expressed channels reveal tremendous variation in voltage-dependent gating.\n[1c] CLC-2 currents are typically inwardly rectifying and activated by hyperpolarization, but the kinetics and degree of rectification are highly variable (Bosl et al., 2001; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018).\n[1c] In some cases, this variability is understood – for example interactions between CLC-2 and the astrocytic GlialCAM protein yields voltage-independent currents (Jeworutzki et al., 2012; Maduke and Reimer, 2012).\n[2c] Yet many questions about CLC-2 gating remain.\n[1c] Like CLC-1, CLC-2 gating depends critically on Egate (Niemeyer et al., 2003; Cederholm et al., 2010).\n[1c] At zero mV, CLC-2 is predominantly in the closed state (Stolting et al., 2013; Stolting et al., 2014; Jentsch and Pusch, 2018), presumably with Egate blocking the pore.\n[2b] Such pore localization for Egate was modeled in a recent CLC-2 cryoEM structure (Ma et al., 2023); however, experimental density for the sidechain was lacking, and therefore the precise structure of this gate remains uncertain (Figure 1B).\n[1c] Structures with improved resolution will be crucial to understanding CLC-2 gating, which involves interactions between Egate, Cl- and H+, with differential effects of external vs internal ions (Pusch et al., 1999; Niemeyer et al., 2003; Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2010; Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2012; De Jesus-Perez et al., 2016).\n[1c] In addition to the Egate mechanism, a “ball-and-chain” gating mechanism, in which the tethered N-terminus blocks the pore, has been proposed for CLC-2 (Grunder et al., 1992).\n[2c] However, this idea has been controversial (Varela et al., 2002) and the mechanism by which mutations in the N-terminal domain influence gating remains unknown.\n[1c] Because a structural foundation for understanding CLC-2 gating has been lacking, we determined cryoEM structures of CLC-2, in the presence and absence of the selective inhibitor AK-42 (Koster et al., 2020).\n[3a] The structures and complementary electrophysiology data presented here provide atomic insight into an N-terminal hairpin gating mechanism for CLC-2 channels."}]}

the pancreas that plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis [1–5].\nMature insulin is stored in the hexameric form within the pancreas [6–8] and is produced via enzymatic cleavage of proinsulin, which contains a C-chain peptide connecting A and B-chains [9–11].\nThe C-peptide is cleaved by the specific endopeptidases resulting in the mature form of the insulin [12,13].\nActivity in vivo involves dissociation of the storage hexameric form initially into dimers and then to a monomer which engages with insulin receptor (IR) [9,14].\nMonomeric bioactive human insulin has been structurally well-characterized and is a 51 amino acid peptide consisting of two chains A and B with 21, 30 amino acids respectively [9,15,16].\nThe chains are held together by two inter-chain disulfide bridges(A7-B7; A20-B19) and further stabilised by an intra-A-chain cysteine linkage (A6-A11) [15,17,18].\nAbnormalities in insulin secretion or resistance to insulin leads to type-1 or 2 diabetes [15,18–21].\nMonomeric insulin mediates a host of important functions primarily through its engagement with the IR.1,18,22,23 The IR belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family of proteins that include type 1 and 2 insulin like growth factor receptors (IGF1- and IGF-2R) and the orphan insulin receptor-related receptor [15,18,22].\nThe RTKs share a common architecture consisting of an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane segment and an intracellular kinase domain [15,18,20].\nThe RTKs form homodimers as quaternary structures and undergo conformational rearrangements upon ligand binding that results in auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues intracellularly and downstream signaling [18,23].\nKey physiological functions mediated by IR activation include glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles, diminished glucose synthesis in hepatocytes and lipid degradation in adipocytes [1,15,18,19,21].\nThese roles of insulin-mediated IR activation in metabolism and homeostasis make them primary targets for metabolic disorders such as diabetes that affect millions of lives globally [19,21,22].\nInsulin has been well-studied for nearly a century but a molecular level understanding of its receptor binding and subsequent signaling remains unclear.18,21,24 For a long time this was due to lack of high resolution structures of insulin bound to the IR.\nA key structural breakthrough was achieved when McKern et al., provided us with the first glimpse of the IR ectodomain and revealed an inverted ‘V’ like conformation in the absence of insulin [23].\nIn 2013, the first high resolution structure of an insulin-IR complex revealed a single insulin molecule bound to the extracellular domain of the IR [18].\nThis structure showed that the high-affinity (HA) binding site of insulin lies between the leucine-rich L1 domain and the C-terminus of the α-domain (α-CT) [18].\nIn 2018, single electron microscopy (EM) experiments have shown that activation of the insulin-IR complex involved transitioning from an inverted ‘V’ conformation to a T-like state that is thought to allow the transmembrane domains to come in proximity to each other and result in auto-phosphorylation and downstream signaling [25]. \nDuring the course of this work, other structures have demonstrated the presence of the hypothesised low-affinity insulin binding sites at the IR which have revealed the complexities of ligand-receptor engagement (Table S1) [2,2,18,26,26–29].\nIn contrast to IR-insulin complexes, the structure of free insulin has been known for decades [6,7,30–32].\nMultiple computational studies have focused on understanding the conformational dynamics of the molecule in the monomeric, dimeric and Zn2+ mediated hexameric states [33–39].\nThese include the use of computational alanine scanning, free energy calculations with MMGBSA, study of solvent mediated effects, and enhanced sampling methods to understand the conformational spread within the insulin molecule [39–42].\nIn parallel, Kiselyov et. al formulated a harmonic oscillator model to explain empirical results from insulin binding experiments with IR and IGF-1R [43].\nPrevious in silico studies of insulin behavior in complex with IR relied on docking generated models of the bound state [33].\nHowever, experimental structures with insulin bound revealed differences between the docking solutions used in those studies, with the actual bound conformation of insulin [18,25–29,44].\nWhereas, the previous computational studies provided important glimpses into the function of insulin at a molecular level, a complete picture of insulin activity at the IR remains elusive.\nWe leveraged new structural information that has emerged in the last few years with regards to insulin-IR complexes to build a deeper understanding of the hormone function (Table S1) [2,2,18,28,29,45].\nIn this study, we used MD simulations along with an adaptation of the powerful free energy perturbation (FEP) method to perform in silico mutagenesis, in order to map and understand the contribution of different residues and domains on receptor binding and activation [46].\nFEP has been widely used to compute relative protein-ligand binding affinities for small-molecules and mapping the effect of mutating receptor residues [46], however, to the best of our knowledge this is the first use of the method for assessing mutations in bound polypeptide ligands, such as insulin [47–49].\nUnlike, with other faster free energy estimation methods, the use of FEP allows for deconvolution of the energy contributions of individual residues and can shed light on the role of waters due to the use of explicit solvation.\nHence, in this work, MD and FEP are used as the foundations to understand the structural drivers of insulin activity and function via the IR.\nIn order to probe the utility of MD and FEP in enhancing our understanding of insulin engagement with its receptor we divided our study into three defined segments.\nInitially, we provide a baseline for ligand stability in the binding site and map out key interactions between WT-Ins and IR using short MD simulations.\nNext, we looked at naturally occurring disease-linked variants of human insulin to see if we can understand the molecular drivers behind the loss-of-function seen with these mutants using FEP.\nFinally, we extended the FEP calculations to study a variety of well-characterized man-made insulin variants in order to link amino acid residue changes to the different potency profiles that they display.\nThese calculations help us to provide the relationship between observed metabolic potency and correlate it with the corresponding atomic changes.\nThis atomic level information could be used to designing new insulin variants.\nIn addition, a recapitulation of functional profiles across different analog types would act as a demonstration of the generalizability of the FEP method as a tool for performing in silico mutagenesis towards the design of novel peptides and proteins.\nIn this article, we use the term “ligand” as nomenclature in place of “insulin” or “insulin

complexes?\n[1c] Recent work in physics-based docking approaches tested induced-fit docking [2], large ensembles [15], and fast-fourier transforms with improved energy functions [16] to capture conformational changes and better dock protein structures.\n[1c] Coupling temperature replica exchange with induced-fit docking, ReplicaDock 2.02 achieved successful local docking predictions on 80% of rigid (unbound-to-bound root mean square deviation, RMSDUB < 1.1Å) and 61% medium (1.1 ≤ RMSDUB < 2.2 Å) targets in the Docking Benchmark 5.0 set [17].\n[1c] However, like most state-of-the-art physics-based docking methods, ReplicaDock 2.0 performance was limited for highly flexible targets: 33% success rate on targets with RMSDUB ≥ 2.2 Å. Promisingly, by focusing backbone moves on known mobile residues (i.e., residues that exhibit conformational changes upon binding), ReplicaDock 2.0 sampling substantially improved the docking accuracy.\n[1c] But the flexible residues must first, somehow, be identified.\n[1c] Additionally, physics-based docking is quite slow (6-8 hrs on a 24-core CPU cluster) compared to recent DL based docking tools (0.1-10 minutes on a single NVIDIA GPU).\n[1c] However, docking-specific DL tools such as EquiDock [18] and dMASIF [19] do not allow for protein flexibility, and recent tools like GeoDock [20], and DockGPT [21] have very limited backbone flexibility.\n[1c] Further, all of these DL docking tools have low success rates on unbound docking targets such as those in Docking Benchmark 5.5 [20].\n[3b] In this work, we combine the features of a top deep learning approach (AlphaFold-multimer [4]) with physics-based docking schemes (ReplicaDock 2.02) to systematically dock protein interfaces.\n[3b] The overarching goal is to create a robust pipeline for easier, reproducible, and accurate modeling of protein complexes.\n[3b] We investigate the aforementioned questions and create a protocol to resolve AFm failures and capture binding-induced conformational changes.\n[3b] We first assess the utility of AFm confidence metrics to detect conformational flexibility and binding site confidence.\n[3b] Next, we feed these metrics and the AFm-generated structural template to ReplicaDock 2.0, creating a pipeline we call AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking).\n[3b] We test AlphaRED’s docking accuracy on a curated set of benchmark targets of bound and unbound protein structures of varying levels of binding-induced conformational change, including antibody-antigen interfaces, which additionally challenge AF2m due to the lack of evolutionary information across the interface [22,23].\n[3b] In summary, we to assess the promise of combining the best of deep learning and biophysical approaches for predicting challenging protein complexes."}]}

remarkable regenerative capabilities (1,2).\nAlmost any excised tissue piece as well as cellular re-aggregates are capable of reforming a fully viable adult in just a few days.\nIn the former example, an excised tissue piece folds back into a closed spherical shape with both its epithelial monolayers, endoderm and ectoderm, engulfing a water-filled lumen.\nIn the latter, the same tissues start by spontaneously sorting into their relative positions (3,4) before expelling excess cells to reform a hollow sphere.\nAt this point, both regenerative trajectories converge and these tissue spheres start undergoing osmotically-driven oscillations during which they swell because of water flowing from the environment to the lumen up to the point where the tension building up within the tissues becomes too large and leads to a local rupture (5,6).\nAfter rupture, the samples deflate, close the resulting wound and start another swelling-rupture cycle.\nThese osmotic oscillations induce deformations and therefore stresses within the tissues with relative changes in the radii of the spheres up to 30%.\nThese have been referred to as phase I oscillations and are characterized by a high amplitude and a low frequency.\nIndeed, after a few of these cycles, the oscillations clearly change and enter phase II where they have lower amplitude and higher frequency (6).\nIn parallel to these mechanical oscillations, the samples establish a chemical pattern involving some characterized morphogens to define the oral-aboral axis of the organism.\nMost notably, a local expression of HyWnt3 has been shown to be an early signal of axial patterning with this activation defining the future position of the head organizer (7).\nThis local activation is then followed by the establishment of various chemical gradients within the spheres effectively patterning the whole axis (8,9).\nAt that point, the originally symmetrical samples start elongating in an oblong shape at which ends the adult organs of the head and foot will be regenerated, and the patterning can be considered complete.\nThe switch between phase I and phase II oscillations was thought to be a signature of the establishment of axial patterning (6,10).\nSince small excised tissue pieces showed both phases, it was thought that they underwent spontaneous symmetry breaking and retained no memory of axial patterning just as cellular re-aggregates.\nThe question was then to determine how the spherical symmetry was broken during phase I oscillations and how the local head organizer was defined.\nFor a long time, the main hypothesis was that of a purely biochemical spontaneous symmetry breaking in the form of Turing-instabilities of an unknown reaction-diffusion system.\nIn his seminal work, partially inspired by Hydra regeneration, Turing has shown how a system of two interacting and diffusing chemical species, which he named morphogens, could become unstable in their homogenous state and spontaneously start forming structures such as dots or stripes (11).\nThese ideas were critical in developing the field of pattern formation and have been adapted to a wide variety of systems and organisms (see for example (12,13) for recent reviews in the context of developmental biology).\nIn this historical development, Hydra has retained its place as a model organism.\nNotably, Gierer and Meinhardt have expanded on the seminal ideas of Turing and developed a modified version of his reaction-diffusion system specifically designed to explain regeneration and grafting experiments in Hydra (14).\nAs a result, the so-called Gierer-Meinhardt model has long been the gold standard in the field.\nAt its inception, it was purely speculative but, since then, some proteins have been shown to possess many of the characteristics required by the Gierer-Meinhardt model.\nMost notably, the protein HyWnt3, involved in the canonical Wnt pathway is now generally considered to be the activator represented in the Gierer-Meinhardt model (15) since its expression is restricted to the head organizer, it has self-activating capacities and it is the first temporal signature of symmetry breaking during regeneration.\nStill, these models ignore the mechanical aspects of the process, most notably the osmotic oscillations although it is now well established that they are necessary for proper regeneration (16,17).\nThis observation suggested a possible coupling between the mechanical state of the tissues and their biological response, as has been observed in a variety of contexts and organisms with impacts on cell division or gene expression including in the canonical Wnt pathway (18–21).\nRecent results have demonstrated such a coupling in Hydra by which the expression of HyWnt3 is reduced when osmotic oscillations are blocked (17) providing a potential direct coupling between tissue mechanics and chemical patterning.\nRecent modelling efforts have thus been made in order to incorporate mechano-chemical couplings (16,22,23), for instance by making the diffusion constant of the morphogens within the tissues dependent on tissue stretch (16).\nIn most cases though, these couplings were not grounded in experimental evidence.\nIn addition, recent experimental results have started to question the assumptions described so far and underlying these models.\nFirst, it was shown that the shift from phase I to phase II oscillations was not a direct signature of axial patterning being established.\nInstead, the onset of phase II is due to the early apparition of the Hydra mouth (24) allowing it to regulate its osmotic imbalance by mouth opening rather than by tissue rupture.\nOne consequence was that axial patterning had to be anterior to the shift between oscillation phases.\nIt then became unclear whether small excised tissue pieces really went through de novo patterning or if they could inherit this patterning from their original host organism.\nRecent experimental results show that they do retain axial patterning although the exact mechanism by which they do so remains unclear, whether by the organization of their ectodermal actin structures called myonemes (25) or by pre-existing biochemical gradients (26).\nAlthough small excised tissue pieces retain axial patterning, it still remains that 1-cellular re-aggregates which cannot conserve either supracellular actin structures or chemical gradients have to show de novo axial patterning during osmotic oscillations, 2-there is evidence of a direct coupling between tissue deformations and Hywnt3 expression (17), one of the most important morphogens involved in Hydra patterning and 3-osmotic oscillations are required for the proper elongation, morphogenesis and regeneration of both excised tissue pieces and cellular re-aggregates.\nFor all these reasons, the focus of the field is currently shifting to an integrated view of Hydra regeneration as a mechano-biological process (23,27).\nOne clear roadblock to the development of these ideas is our lack of understanding of the rheological properties and mechanical state of regenerating Hydra tissue spheres.\nThis often leads to assumptions as to the rheology of these samples and rough estimates of their key mechanical parameters.\nOne exception is the development by Veschgini and colleagues of a two-fingered robotic hand allowing them to apply known, constant deformations on the tissue spheres and measure the resulting forces (28) giving the first local, quantitative measurements of mechanical features in Hydra.\nThese measurements were not, however, used to deepen our understanding of the spontaneous osmotic oscillations.\nIn this work, we try to overcome these limitations and to offer a quantitative characterization of the mechanics of Hydra tissue spheres.\nTo do so, we used the well-established micro-aspiration technique (29–32) which we adapted to increase its throughput through the use of original microfluidic constructs following (33).\nWe found three different mechanical behaviors as the aspiration pressure was increased: first an elastic response, then a viscoelastic one and finally tissue rupture, as observed in phase I oscillations.\nCombining our experimental observations and measurements with the development of a rheological model of elastic shells and numerical simulations, we obtained quantitative measurements of both the main rheological parameters of Hydra tissue spheres and the critical pressures required to switch between the three regimes.\nThanks to these results, we provide a description of internal tissue mechanics, strains and stresses during osmotic oscillations.\nHopefully, this mechanical characterization will serve as a stepping stone for the study of

for therapeutic purposes [1,2].\nTranscription factor complexes are one class of particular interest for this approach, as small molecule disruptors of specific protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions could potentially modulate the aberrant transcription activities associated with many diseases.\nHowever, with few notable exceptions, transcription factors are perceived as ‘undruggable’ due to their lack of any targetable catalytic sites [3], and the associated challenges of finding small molecules which can specifically bind to and inhibit the large, flat surfaces usually involved in binding other proteins or DNA [4–6].\nHere, we focus on the characterization of small molecule binding with a transcription factor subunit, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), as a case study of exploiting inherent opportunities for developing inhibitors that target transcription factor/coactivator interactions.\nARNT belongs to the basic Helix Loop Helix - Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors, named for their shared N-terminal DNA binding bHLH motif and two PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B) which all mediate binding the requisite DNA and protein components required for their function [7].\nThe bHLH-PAS proteins can be broadly divided into the signal-regulated class I and the constitutively-expressed class II subunits.\nARNT is a class II protein which serves as a ‘universal’ binding partner to several class I bHLH-PAS proteins, including the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-α), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), neuronal PAS proteins (NPAS), and single-minded proteins (SIM) [7].\nOnce formed, these heterodimers control a plethora of biological processes, including hypoxia adaptation, xenobiotic metabolism, and neurogenesis [7].\nTwo well-characterized examples of ARNT-containing signaling cascades which respond to environmental stimuli are the xenobiotic-sensing AHR and hypoxia-regulated HIF pathways (8) (Fig. 1).\nFor the former, AHR regulates the vertebrate xenobiotic response pathway by its binding to a wide variety of small molecules, ranging from pollutants (e.g., [2,3,7,8] - tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, “dioxin”)) to dietary compounds [9–11].\nIn the cytosol, inactivated AHR is bound to and stabilized by the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone and other auxiliary proteins [12,13].\nLigand binding to the AHR PAS-B domain triggers a poorly-understood response which includes translocation of cytosolic AHR into the nucleus, where it heterodimerizes with ARNT to form the functional heterodimeric transcription factor that binds to dioxin response elements (DREs) upstream of AHR-controlled genes and initiates their transcription [14].\nThe HIF pathway, on the other hand, mediates cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) [15–17].\nUnder normoxia, the HIF-α subunits (HIF-1α, 2α, 3α) are rapidly degraded and inactivated through oxygen-dependent pathways; these controls are relieved under hypoxic conditions, letting the HIF-α subunits accumulate and dimerize with ARNT in the nucleus [17].\nThe HIF-α/ARNT heterodimer complexes bind to hypoxia response elements (HREs) upstream of HIF-controlled genes, leading to erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and metabolic remodeling [16–18].\nIn the quiescent state, AHR resides in the cytoplasm in a complex with other proteins including heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP), and p23.\nUpon ligand binding, AHR translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with ARNT.\nHIF activation is oxygen dependent, relying on the action O2-utilizing hydroxylases.\nUnder normoxic conditions, the HIF-α subunits are rapidly degraded and inactivated by downstream effects of hydroxylation.\nUnder hypoxic conditions, HIF-α dimerizes with the β-subunit (ARNT) in the nucleus.\nBoth AHR and HIF complexes recruit various coactivators as part of the transcription activation process.\nDysregulation of both the AHR and HIF pathways has been implicated in many diseases.\nFor example, AHR is an important modulator of host-environment interactions and plays critical roles in immune and inflammatory responses [19].\nOveractivation of AHR can also stimulate tumorigenesis, making it a promising but still underutilized therapeutic target for cancer therapies [20,21].\nIn comparison, anomalous HIF activities may lead to anemia, inflammation, and ischemia [16,22–25].\nPersistent HIF activation can also contribute to tumor growth and progression, aiding tumor cell survival and therapy resistance [22,25,26].\nWhile several strategies targeting different parts of the HIF pathway have been tested, the most efficacious ones focus solely on the HIF-2α isoform [18,27–31], including the clinically-utilized HIF-2α inhibitor belzutifan [32–38].\nAs with many other transcription factors, AHR and HIF rely on a variety of functionally important coactivators to execute their programs [39–42], opening potential other opportunities for small molecule control of their signaling properties.\nThese include a group of coactivators known as the coiled-coil coactivators (CCCs) [41,43–47], recruited via the ARNT PAS-B domain and thus establishing the ARNT PAS-B/coactivator interaction as a potential target for intervention [41,44,46].\nIn addition, the coiled-coil protein coiled-coil coactivator (CoCoA) CCC protein has been proposed as a primary coactivator of the AHR/ARNT complex, and interacts with the bHLH-PAS regions of both proteins [45], suggesting that ARNT/CCC interactions could be a point of modulation for both HIF and AHR pathways.\nUsing NMR-based fragment screening and in vitro interaction assays, we identified 10 compounds that bound ARNT PAS-B with micromolar affinities, including two compounds (KG-548, KG-655) capable of disrupting its interactions with the another CCC protein, the Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil Containing Protein 3 (TACC3) [48].\nWhile characterizing the binding sites of these ligands has been technically challenging, we recently reported an ARNT/KG-548 cocrystal structure, showing that KG-548 binds on the surface of ARNT PAS-B [49].\nAlthough this binding site is reasonable and appears to be privileged for protein and small molecule interactions [50], solution validation of this binding mode is essential [49].\nMeanwhile, the binding mode of KG-655 and others remained unclear from these studies.\nTo address these knowledge gaps, we investigated the binding modes of several small molecules with the ARNT PAS-B domain using solution NMR spectroscopy, weighted ensemble molecular dynamics (WEMD) simulations, and ensemble docking.\nWe used three ligands, KG-548, KG-655, and KG-279, as proof-of-concept small molecules to showcase two ligand binding modes: one on the external side of the PAS β-sheet (consistent with our KG-548/ARNT crystal structure [49]) and an internal cavity previously seen by x-ray diffraction [48].\nNotably these three compounds differentially preferred binding these sites, likely correlated to their sizes and chemical features.\nWe also used ensemble docking to determine potential binding poses of KG-655 and KG-279 in the internal cavity that satisfied NOE-based protein/ligand distances, showing marked distortion of the protein domain upon ligand binding.\nTaken together, this study validates the previously-proposed surface binding site for KG-548 and provided the first direct evidence of ligands binding inside the ARNT PAS-B domain cavity, all of which will aid designing more

physiological processes in organisms.\nAmong them, neuropeptides possessing the Arg-Phe-NH2 (RFamide) motif at their C-termini are designated as RFamide peptides and have attracted considerable attentions because of their pivotal roles in various biological functions [1–3].\nThe RF-amide family encompasses five distinct peptides: Neuropeptide FF (NPFF), Prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), Kisspeptin (Kiss1), gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), and pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (QRFP).\nEach peptide interacts with specific class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiating a cascade of intracellular events to modulate physiological responses.\nSimilarly, the RY-amide peptides, characterized by the signature RY motif at their C-termini, present a similar mode of action, interacting with their respective receptors to regulate physiological processes [4].\nThis categorization based on the C-terminal residues highlights the specificity and diversity within these peptide families.\nThe intricate interplay between these peptides and their receptors represents a complex network critical for maintaining homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.\nQRFP is a 43-amino acid RFamide peptide with a pyroglutamylated N-terminus (namely 43Rfa).\nQRFP was originally identified by a bioinformatics approach and reverse pharmacology[5], and demonstrates specific activity for GPR103 with orexigenic activity[5–7], a Gq-coupled receptor expressed in the brain and adrenal gland.\nGPR103 is predominantly localized in the central nervous system, including regions such as the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism and appetite control.\nQRFP and GPR103 are implicated in a variety of physiological functions ranging from the modulation of feeding behavior to the regulation of energy homeostasis [8], cardiovascular function and bone formation [9].\nThis QRFP-GPR103 pair is remarkably conserved across various vertebrate

"[1a] Neuropeptides, a diverse array of signaling molecules, orchestrate a multitude of physiological processes in organisms.\n[1a] Among them, neuropeptides possessing the Arg-Phe-NH2 (RFamide) motif at their C-termini are designated as RFamide peptides and have attracted considerable attentions because of their pivotal roles in various biological functions [1–3].\n[1b] The RF-amide family encompasses five distinct peptides: Neuropeptide FF (NPFF), Prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), Kisspeptin (Kiss1), gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), and pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (QRFP).\n[1b] Each peptide interacts with specific class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiating a cascade of intracellular events to modulate physiological responses.\n[1b] Similarly, the RY-amide peptides, characterized by the signature RY motif at their C-termini, present a similar mode of action, interacting with their respective receptors to regulate physiological processes [4].\n[1b] This categorization based on the C-terminal residues highlights the specificity and diversity within these peptide families.\n[1b] The intricate interplay between these peptides and their receptors represents a complex network critical for maintaining homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.\n[1b] QRFP is a 43-amino acid RFamide peptide with a pyroglutamylated N-terminus (namely 43Rfa).\n[1b] QRFP was originally identified by a bioinformatics approach and reverse pharmacology[5], and demonstrates specific activity for GPR103 with orexigenic activity[5–7], a Gq-coupled receptor expressed in the brain and adrenal gland.\n[1b] GPR103 is predominantly localized in the central nervous system, including regions such as the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism and appetite control.\n[1c] QRFP and GPR103 are implicated in a variety of physiological functions ranging from the modulation of feeding behavior to the regulation of energy homeostasis [8], cardiovascular function and bone formation [9].\n[1c] This QRFP-GPR103 pair is remarkably conserved across various vertebrate species[10], highlighting its fundamental significance in biological systems.\n[1a] GPR103 is not only pivotal in maintaining physiological balance but also presents therapeutic targets for disorders related to metabolism and appetite

supplemental oxygen to prevent mortality in these infants[1–6].\nSupplemental oxygen prevents mortality but also leads to the development of retinal vascular abnormality-retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\nSupplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) downregulates angiogenesis in phase I and causes vaso-obliteration, a precursor to phase II[6].\nEvery year, ROP claims the eyesight of nearly 30,000-40,000 prematurely born infants[7].\nMultiple biochemical pathways have been implicated in the ROP and mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, including serine-one carbon, glutamine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, polyamine pathway, and fatty acid metabolism[6].\nThese metabolic changes in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model and the ROP indicate a biosynthetic deficit.\nProliferating endothelial cells have high biosynthetic demand to proliferate and migrate to develop new blood vessels.\nInhibition of endothelial cell (EC)-specific glutaminase (GLS) has been demonstrated to decrease proliferation and induce senescence in ECs[8, 9].\nIn addition, ablation of glutamine synthetase in Muller cells has been shown to cause EC proliferation defects[10].\nThis shows that glutamine production and utilization by the retina need to be balanced during angiogenesis.\nSimilarly, loss of serine transporter from the retina demonstrates aberrant angiogenesis in the retina[11].\nIn addition, polyamine pathway metabolites have also been shown to cause neovascular defects in the retinal and retinal cell types[12, 13].\nThese findings demonstrate that biosynthetic pathways are essential during angiogenesis.\nGlycolysis and OXPHOS provide ATP necessary for cellular function; however, biosynthetic pathways like serine-one carbon, glutamine and polyamine pathways are necessary for the cells to divide.\nAt the cellular level, serine-one carbon metabolites are essential for glutathione production, NADPH synthesis, and Heme production pathways[2].\nSerine-one carbon is the only source of methylation in the early developmental stages[14].\nAt the same time, glutamine is an essential nutrient for cellular proliferation[10].\nGlutamine and downstream urea cycle metabolites arginine and ornithine also serve as precursors for polyamine pathway metabolites[15].\nGlutamine is present in millimolar ranges, both in humans and mice, and because of its high abundance, it also serves as an alternative source of energy.\nHowever, glutamine filling into TCA is bad for proliferating tissue as this lowers the amount available for biosynthetic reactions and produces ammonium, a toxic end product.\nCarbon sources that can produce energy via the TCA cycle, other than glycolysis and glutaminolysis, are fatty acids and branched amino acids.\nNewborns rely on fatty acids as their main energy source, as fats account for 40-50% of calories in the mother’s milk[16].\nFree fatty acid also contributes to the majority of energy generation during fetal development[16].\nDuring development, the fetus is supplied with free fatty acids from the maternal circulation.\nBitman et. al. have demonstrated that the fatty acid composition of the mother’s milk

good energy source as they don’t need a carnitine-based transport to be oxidized, unlike required for long and very long chain fatty acids in many tissues, except for a few tissue types[18].\nIn

supplemental oxygen to prevent mortality in these infants[1–6].\n[1b] Supplemental oxygen prevents mortality but also leads to the development of retinal vascular abnormality-retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\n[1b] Supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) downregulates angiogenesis in phase I and causes vaso-obliteration, a precursor to phase II[6].\n[1b] Every year, ROP claims the eyesight of nearly 30,000-40,000 prematurely born infants[7].\n[1b] Multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated in the ROP and mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, including serine-one carbon, glutamine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, polyamine pathway, and fatty acid metabolism[6].\n[1b] These metabolic changes in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model and the ROP indicate a biosynthetic deficit.\n[1b] Proliferating endothelial cells have high biosynthetic demand to proliferate and migrate to develop new blood vessels.\n[1c] Inhibition of endothelial cell (EC)-specific glutaminase (GLS) has been demonstrated to decrease proliferation and induce senescence in ECs[8, 9].\n[1c] In addition, ablation of glutamine synthetase in Muller cells has been shown to cause EC proliferation defects[10].\n[1c] This shows that glutamine production and utilization by the retina need to be balanced during angiogenesis.\n[1c] Similarly, loss of serine transporter from the retina demonstrates aberrant angiogenesis in the retina[11].\n[1c] In addition, polyamine pathway metabolites have also been shown to cause neovascular defects in the retinal and retinal cell types[12, 13].\n[1a] These findings demonstrate that biosynthetic pathways are essential during angiogenesis.\n[1c] Glycolysis and OXPHOS provide ATP necessary for cellular function; however, biosynthetic pathways like serine-one carbon, glutamine and polyamine pathways are necessary for the cells to divide.\n[1c] At the cellular level, serine-one carbon metabolites are essential for glutathione production, NADPH synthesis, and Heme production pathways[2].\n[1c] Serine-one carbon is the only source of methylation in the early developmental stages[14].\n[1c] At the same time, glutamine is an essential nutrient for cellular proliferation[10].\n[1c] Glutamine and downstream urea cycle metabolites arginine and ornithine also serve as precursors for polyamine pathway metabolites[15].\n[1c] Glutamine is present in millimolar ranges, both in humans and mice, and because of its high abundance, it also serves as an alternative source of energy.\n[1c] However, glutamine filling into TCA is bad for proliferating tissue as this lowers the amount available for biosynthetic reactions and produces ammonium, a toxic end product.\n[1c] Carbon sources that can produce energy via the TCA cycle, other than glycolysis and glutaminolysis, are fatty acids and branched amino acids.\n[1c] Newborns rely on fatty acids as their main energy source, as fats account for 40-50% of calories in the mother’s milk[16].\n[1c] Free fatty acid also contributes to the majority of energy generation during fetal development[16].\n[1c] During development, the fetus is supplied with free fatty acids from the maternal circulation.\n[1c] Bitman et. al. have demonstrated that the fatty acid composition of the mother’s milk in premature and full-term infants differs in medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs)[17].\n[1c] The

for antiplatelet therapies[11–13].\nOver the past 10 years, platelet thrombin receptors have been appealing targets for antiplatelet therapies, which led to the first-in-class FDA approved PAR1 inhibitor, vorapaxar.\nHowever, targeting PAR1 comes with a significant risk of bleeding, which outweighs its clinical benefits in preventing cardiovascular events[14,15].\nIn recent years, PAR4 has become a rising star as a safer antiplatelet and antithrombotic target for a number of reasons.\nFirst, targeting PAR4 signaling without inhibiting PAR1 allows platelets to continue to respond to low levels of thrombin and preserves normal hemostasis[12].\nSecond, pharmacological inhibition of PAR4 prevents thrombin-mediated PAR4 activation at high concentrations that are associated with pathological thrombosis.\nThird, since the prolonged signaling mediated by PAR4 activation is associated with factor V release from α-granules and microparticle generation[16], selectively inhibiting PAR4 would not only prevent thrombus formation but also reduce platelet procoagulant activity[11].\nCollectively, this has culminated in the development of a number of PAR4 antagonists in the form of

movement, muscles function surprisingly better as brakes than motors (1).\nAccordingly, muscle forces are enhanced during and following active muscle stretch (i.e., eccentric contraction) compared with contractions at a constant length (i.e., isometric contraction) or during active muscle shortening (i.e., concentric contraction) when muscle activity is matched (2–5).\nAccordingly, producing a given force eccentrically requires less muscle activity compared with an isometric or a concentric contraction.\nSince active muscle volume theoretically determines energy expenditure (6), the neuromuscular efficiency of eccentric contractions is therefore increased (7, 8).\nAs eccentric contractions require less energy and muscle activity for equivalent force production, eccentric exercise has received considerable attention over the last decades to rehabilitate injuries, to improve athletic performance, and to help manage neuromuscular diseases (9–13).\nAccordingly, many training studies aimed to determine the specific adaptations of the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) to eccentric exercise in comparison to concentric exercise.\nThe specific adaptations to eccentric exercise primarily include an increase in fascicle length (14).\nHowever, the fascicle length increases following eccentric exercise are highly variable among studies.\nBy examining 15 in vivo human studies on training adaptations to eccentric exercise (11, 15–28), we found that fascicle length changed from −3% (i.e., decreased) to 34% (i.e., increased, see Figure S1).\nAccordingly, it is important to question why the fascicle length changes to eccentric exercise are so variable.\nOne factor that could affect the muscle lengths and forces attained during and following eccentric contractions and the subsequent MTU adaptations following eccentric exercise is the pre-activation timing and level before MTU stretch.\nBecause of the typical arrangement of a distal elastic tendon in series with a muscle within a lower limb MTU, the length changes of muscle and tendon can be decoupled (29, 30).\nFor example, a muscle can still shorten against the elastic tendon while the MTU is stretched when there is no pre-activation.\nAccordingly, apparent eccentric exercises (i.e., MTU lengthening exercises) do not necessarily result in isolated eccentric contractions, but can result in a combination of muscle contraction types.\nTherefore, the highly variable fascicle length changes to apparent eccentric exercise could be due to different muscle fascicle behaviors during these exercises.\nDuring apparent eccentric exercise, the decoupling of muscle and tendon length changes can also affect the fascicle stretch amplitudes (31, 32).\nDifferences in fascicle stretch amplitude during eccentric exercises might affect peak fascicle force during stretch, the residual force enhancement (rFE) following stretch (33–35), and the active and passive contributions to eccentric force production.\nThis is because rFE was found to be related to the peak force and/or torque during stretch (33, 36, 37).\nHowever, it is unclear whether peak force is affected more by stretch amplitude or fascicle length (38).\nIt is also unclear whether the rFE following active muscle stretch is affected more by the stretch amplitude or the final muscle length.\nAnimal studies showed that rFE increased with increasing muscle stretch amplitude up until a point when stretching occurred at lengths where passive muscle force naturally existed (2, 39).\nA more recent in vivo study on the human knee extensors however showed that rFE primarily depends on the final fascicle length rather than the fascicle stretch amplitude during submaximal MTU-stretch-hold contractions (40).\nThese findings are potentially relevant for the specific adaptations to eccentric exercise as rFE is thought to be related to the properties of the giant muscle protein titin.\nIn turn, changes in titin stiffness have been reported to drive longitudinal muscle hypertrophy (41), which could be another potential reason for the highly variable fascicle length adaptations to eccentric exercise reported in the literature.\nTherefore, the aim of this research was to study the effect of MTU series elasticity on the fascicle kinematics (i.e., behavior) and kinetics (i.e., force and work) during apparent eccentric exercise.\nChanges in human tibialis anterior (TA) MTU series elasticity were induced by implementing three different pre-activation timings and levels (PLs) that were torque controlled (0, 50%, and 95% of the joint-angle-specific peak active torque) prior to MTU stretch.\nWe hypothesized that both fascicle shortening and stretch amplitudes would increase with increasing PL because of a reduction in MTU series elasticity.\nBased on these expected fascicle kinematics, we also hypothesized that both the positive and negative fascicle work produced during the contractions would increase with increasing PL.\nWe further hypothesized that similar peak forces during MTU stretch would occur at similar fascicle lengths following different fascicle stretch amplitudes that would be in accordance with TA’s active force-length relation (42, 43).\nOur final hypothesis was that rFE would not be related to fascicle stretch amplitude, but to the peak fascicle force achieved during MTU stretch.\nThis is

targets, and enhanced personalised medicine.\n[1c] Therefore, developing novel 3D models of pancreatic islets is of high importance to aid the study of the pathophysiology of diabetes and to better understand the response to various compounds and therapeutics.\n[1c] Dispersion of whole islets and their subsequent reaggregation into spheroids offers one such method with the advantage of adherent long-term culture under suitable conditions and the potential for more efficient transgene delivery.\n[1c] A previous study attempted to use reaggregation and the subsequent formation and maintenance of islet organoids by using novel expansion and proliferation culture media.\n[1c] These islet clusters harboured key islet hormone-producing cell types and showed a higher degree of proliferation than native islets.\n[1c] However, this paradigm has limitations such as: (i) islet-derived cell clusters could only be generated from pregnant mice or wild-type rats, (ii) cluster numbers were small and inadequate for transcriptomic studies, (iii) the islet clusters were not functionally evaluated, and (iv) the presence of a resident immune population was not determined [11].\n[2a] Stem cell-derived pancreatic organoids are an alternative.\n[2a] These cells are generated by directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells and can be cultured over the long term.\n[2a] However, they also suffer from limitations, including not exhibiting all hormone-producing cell types, non-physiological insulin secretion, and a lack of a resident immune population.\n[3a] Given the need for alternative methods for the long-term culture of primary islets, we aimed to refine reaggregation techniques to generate a superior adherent 3D islet culture platform using native murine or human islets as the source.\n[3b] These reaggregated islets are referred to as reformed islets.\n[3b] They can be maintained in culture for at least 4-6 weeks, making them ideal for long-term studies, including high-resolution imaging, suitable for repeated functional assessment, and studying cell-cell communication.\n[3c] We found the reformed islets to be architecturally, transcriptionally, and functionally highly similar to the native islets they are generated from."}]}

metabolic rate and improve survival, particularly during harsh, winter conditions where food supply is limited, and thermogenic demands are high [1].\nDuring hibernation, mammals typically undergo a decrease in body temperature, heart, and breathing rates [2–4].\nIn so-called fat-storing hibernators, this is inherently accompanied by prolonged fasting and fatty acids become the main substrate for energy provision [5, 6].\nBesides these common features associated with overall metabolic depression, there are also significant inter-species differences in the underlying strategies.\nFor instance, small (< 8 kg) fat-storing hibernating mammals such as thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) or garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) experience extended bouts of a hypo-metabolic state (torpor), punctuated by spontaneous periods of interbout euthermic arousals (IBA), during which metabolic activity transiently increases back to basal levels.\nDuring torpor, metabolic rate decreases below 5% of euthermic values and core body temperatures decrease from 35°C − 38°C to 4°C − 8°C [7, 8].\nIn contrast, either medium (10-20 kg, e.g. European badger, Meles meles) or large (> 20 kg, e.g. Eurasian brown bear, Ursus arctos, and American black bear, Ursus americanus) hibernating mammals exhibit a pronounced hypo-metabolic state (as low as 25% of their basal metabolic rate in the case of bears), but only experience a mild decline in body temperature (to 32-35°C depending on body size) that lasts for several winter months [1, 9, 10].\nWhile species-specific physiological patterns are well-documented, the molecular and cellular mechanisms operative in individual organs to achieve these remain largely undefined.\nSkeletal muscle constitutes approximately 45-55% of body mass and serves as a major determinant of basal metabolic rate and heat production [11, 12].\nPrevious studies have uncovered some specific metabolic changes in skeletal muscle during hibernation [6].\nFor example, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, as well as a suppression of ATP production capacity, has previously been documented in skeletal muscles from I. tridecemlineatus during torpor [13].\nPrevious work has demonstrated that ground squirrels require an optimal dietary ratio of monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fats, approximately 2:1, during their fat-storing period to facilitate effective hibernation [14].\nThe proteome of I. tridecemlineatus has then been shown to be enriched for fatty acid β-oxidation during periods of torpor.\nHowever, some reliance upon carbohydrate metabolism is maintained.\nThe activity of phosphoglucomutase (PGM1) is even increased during torpor [15].\nIn U. arctos, skeletal muscle exhibits a transition from carbohydrate utilization to lipid metabolism, coupled with a reduction in whole-tissue ATP turnover [16].\nMuscle is organized into an array of fibers containing repeating sarcomeres, which are crucial for regulating not only contraction but also metabolism and thermogenesis [17].\nUntil recently, energy consumption in skeletal muscle was thought to be primarily linked to the activity of myosin during muscular contraction [17].\nAdditionally, thermogenesis in skeletal muscle was previously attributed primarily to the electron transport system, in some cases link to uncoupling of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) [18, 19].\nHowever, growing evidence that the sarcomeric metabolic rate and thermogenesis are also controlled by ‘relaxed’ myosin molecules is emerging [20].\nMyosin heads in passive muscle (pCa > 8), can be in different resting metabolic states that maintain a basal level of ATP consumption.\nIn the ‘disordered-relaxed’ (DRX) state, myosin heads are generally not bound to actin and structurally exist in a conformation (so-called ON state) where they primarily exist freely within the interfilamentous space in the sarcomere [21, 22].\nIn the ‘super-relaxed’ (SRX) state, myosin heads adopt a structural conformation against the thick filament backbone (so-called OFF state) [23].\nThis conformation sterically inhibits the ATPase site on the myosin head, significantly reducing both ATP turnover in these molecules and, therefore heat production.\nThe SRX state has an ATP turnover rate five to ten times lower than that of myosin heads in the DRX state [24].\nA 20% shift of myosin heads from SRX to DRX is predicted to increase whole-body energy expenditure by 16% and double skeletal muscle thermogenesis [24].\nWhat remains to be determined is whether, across mammals, increasing the proportions of myosin in the DRX or SRX states serves as a physiological molecular mechanism to fine-tune metabolic demands and thermogenesis.\nThis includes potential contributions to whole-body metabolic depression observed during hibernation.\nHence, in the present study, we hypothesized that a remodelling of the proportions of myosin DRX and SRX conformations within skeletal muscles occurs and is a major suppressor of ATP/metabolic demand during hibernation.\nA recent study on I. tridecemlineatus cardiac muscle supports this hypothesis, finding higher proportions of SRX during torpor [25].\nWe examined isolated skeletal myofibers extracted from both small and large hibernating mammals - I. tridecemlineatus, E. quercinus, U. arctos,
