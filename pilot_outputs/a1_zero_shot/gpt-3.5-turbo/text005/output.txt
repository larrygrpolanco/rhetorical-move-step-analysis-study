Depressive disorders, as one of the main stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, are the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more than 320 million people (WHO, 2017) and imposing a substantial economic burden (Greenberg, 2015). [M1_S1a] [M1_S1b]

These disorders are complex and symptomatically heterogeneous conditions whose treatment is still ineffective in several clinical subtypes, many of which are unknown (Blackburn, 2019). [M2_S1b] [M2_S1e]

Understanding the neurobiology underlying these conditions is crucial for developing more effective therapeutic interventions. [M3_S1]

In this context, modeling depressive symptoms in animal models has been recognized as an essential approach (Nestler and Hyman, 2010). [M3_S1]

The majority of studies investigating depressive aspects in animal models focus on stress-induced models (Charney and Manji, 2004; Alfonso et al., 2005; Leigh, 2008). [M1_S3]

These models typically employ well-established experimental paradigms involving physical stressors (e.g., foot shocks) or psychosocial stressors (e.g., social defeat), followed by behavioral tests to assess alterations in depressive-related behaviors. [M3_S4c]

Classical behavioral tests, such as the forced swim test and sucrose preference test, are commonly employed in animal models of depression due to their established predictive validity. [M3_S4a] [M3_S6]

However, this validity may not be related to the neurobiology of depression (Commons et al., 2017). [M2_S1a]

In this regard, it is questioned whether some of these tests exclusively measure behaviors associated with depressive alterations (Molendijk and De Kloet, 2015). [M2_S1e]

In the literature, even behavioral changes traditionally associated with a depressive-like profile due to stress are not consistent. [M1_S2]

Stepanichev et al. (2016) observed a decrease in sucrose consumption and preference, which was not correlated with immobility in the forced swim test. [M1_S3]

Additionally, Naudon and Jay (2015) identified distinct associations between immobility in the forced swim test and cognitive performance, as well as anxiety-related behaviors. [M1_S3]

In this sense, the punctual use of behavioral tests to distinguish the depressive phenotype seems to generate inconsistent results. [M2_S1e]

In contrast, studying different behavioral categories associated with depressive-like behaviors is essential to understanding the underlying neural patterns (Marques et al., 2022) and gaining a better comprehension of the modeled phenomenon. [M3_S2b] [M3_S6]
