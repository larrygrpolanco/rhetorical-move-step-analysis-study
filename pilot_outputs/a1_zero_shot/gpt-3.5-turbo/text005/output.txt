[1a] Depressive disorders, as one of the main stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, are the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting more than 320 million people (WHO, 2017) and imposing a substantial economic burden (Greenberg, 2015).
[1c] These disorders are complex and symptomatically heterogeneous conditions whose treatment is still ineffective in several clinical subtypes, many of which are unknown (Blackburn, 2019).
[2a] Understanding the neurobiology underlying these conditions is crucial for developing more effective therapeutic interventions.
[1c] In this context, modeling depressive symptoms in animal models has been recognized as an essential approach (Nestler and Hyman, 2010).
[1c] The majority of studies investigating depressive aspects in animal models focus on stress-induced models (Charney and Manji, 2004; Alfonso et al., 2005; Leigh, 2008).
[3a] This study aimed to understand the association between a wide range of behavioral measures and investigate how their covariations characterize the depressive-like phenotype within the population.
[3b] Furthermore, we aimed to examine the predictive value of these behavioral measures in determining susceptibility or resilience to stress in rats exposed to acute inescapable footshocks (IS) compared to those exposed to no shocks (NS).
[3c] We found that behavioral variables exhibit a correlation pattern that distinguishes variables related to susceptibility or resilience to stress.
[3c] Furthermore, we identified a covariation pattern consisting of decreased time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, reduced sucrose preference, and elevated escape failures, consistently distinguishing helpless from not helpless rats.
[2b] Additionally, we discerned distinct phenotypic clusters, including subpopulations entirely characterized by susceptibility or resilience to stress, thus indicating varying stress-coping strategies.
