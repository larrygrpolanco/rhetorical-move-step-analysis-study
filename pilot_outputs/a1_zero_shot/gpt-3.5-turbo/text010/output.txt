[M1_S1b] Autism is one of the most common behavioral changes detected early in life [1].
[M1_S2] Despite extensive research, the etiology of autism remains very complex.
[M1_S2] The cause of autism is linked to the genetic and environmental history of parents which together could lead to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children [2,3].
[M1_S2] A recent survey reveals several hundred distinct sites of nucleotide changes in the genome between patients [4].
[M1_S2] Several environmental and genetic factors identified in humans have already been validated with mouse models [5–6], however, have not yet been associated in all autistic patients [7–8].
[M1_S3] Evidence that the altered level of six miRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-499a-5p) in parents and thus inheritance through the expression of altered phenotypes [9] would lead to the inclusion of a common genetic marker for autism cases.
[M1_S3] Altered levels of RNAs such as non-coding RNAs can be passed on to the next generation via the germline to alter offspring phenotypes [10,11].
[M1_S3] However, how RNA subornation is established and maintained throughout generation remains a matter of speculation.
[M1_S3] Recently, on the activity of sperm RNA characterized in mouse models, a growing number of experiments highlight it as an important source of parental hereditary information above DNA [12–14].
[M1_S3] The six miRNAs listed above are present in sperm RNA in general and are altered in the father of an autistic child.
[M2_S1b] One of the questions posed here is to examine sperm RNA activities of that cover a possible paternally acquired autistic phenotype.
[M2_S1b] Microinjection of sperm RNA into fertilized mouse eggs could lead to variable phenotypes depending on the origin of the males from which the RNA is collected [10].
[M2_S2] In particular, although exposure of total RNA from (human) sperm to fertilized mouse eggs may have adverse effects on offspring, can symptoms of autism also become established in the next generation?
[M3_S2a] Here, we focus on experimentally induced autistic traits, particularly the potential of human sperm RNAs to induce “autism-like” phenotypes in mice.
