[1a] Autism is one of the most common behavioral changes detected early in life.
[1b] Despite extensive research, the etiology of autism remains very complex.
[1c] The cause of autism is linked to the genetic and environmental history of parents which together could lead to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children.
[1c] A recent survey reveals several hundred distinct sites of nucleotide changes in the genome between patients.
[1c] Several environmental and genetic factors identified in humans have already been validated with mouse models.
[2b] However, have not yet been associated in all autistic patients.
[2c] Evidence that the altered level of six miRNAs (miR-19a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-3613-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-499a-5p) in parents and thus inheritance through the expression of altered phenotypes would lead to the inclusion of a common genetic marker for autism cases.
[2b] Altered levels of RNAs such as non-coding RNAs can be passed on to the next generation via the germline to alter offspring phenotypes.
[2d] However, how RNA subornation is established and maintained throughout generation remains a matter of speculation.
[2d] Recently, on the activity of sperm RNA characterized in mouse models, a growing number of experiments highlight it as an important source of parental hereditary information above DNA.
[2a] The six miRNAs listed above are present in sperm RNA in general and are altered in the father of an autistic child.
[2b] Five of six (miR-19a-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-499a-5p) are also present in mouse sperm, the sixth miR-3613-3p does not exist in the mouse genome.
[2c] These six inherited miRNAs are then found downregulated in the sera of autistic patients and 'autism-like' mouse models.
[3a] One of the questions posed here is to examine sperm RNA activities of that cover a possible paternally acquired autistic phenotype.
[3c] Here, we focus on experimentally induced autistic traits, particularly the potential of human sperm RNAs to induce “autism-like” phenotypes in mice.
[3d] Our study involved, the examination of the brain anatomy in animals from all groups, utilising immuno-histochemical stains.
