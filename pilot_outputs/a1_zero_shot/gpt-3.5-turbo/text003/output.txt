Sentence 1: Among the many definitions of recursion (Martins, 2012), the view that it represents the repetition of an element or pattern within a self-similar element or pattern has crossed centuries and disciplines, from von Humboldt (1836) and Hockett (1960), to Mandelbrot (1980) and Chomsky (2010); from fractals in mathematics (Mandelbrot, 1980) to generative grammars in linguistics (Chomsky, 2010), from graphic (e.g., “Print Gallery” by M. C. Escher) to popular art (e.g., 1940’s Batman #8 comic book cover).

Annotations:
- [M1_S1a] Claiming centrality or value of the research area
- [M1_S3] Reviewing a specific previous research study

Sentence 2: Across varying terminologies, the common denominator across fields is that to re-curse (from the Latin to ‘re-run’ or ‘re-invoke’) is an operation that produces multiple, potentially infinite sets of items from one initial item or a finite set.

Annotations:
- [M1_S2] Making generalizations about the research area without mentioning specific studies

Sentence 3: This is achieved by nesting an item within itself or within another item of the same kind.

Annotations:
- [M3_S4c] Describing the analyzed scenario/context of the present research

Sentence 4: Recursive patterns in everyday life are ubiquitous and include, for example, computer folders stored inside other computer folders, Russian dolls nested in each other, Romanesco broccoli’s spirals arranged in a spiral, and the same number of minutes passed within the same number of hours (e.g., 12:12).

Annotations:
- [M3_S4c] Describing the analyzed scenario/context of the present research

Sentence 5: Accordingly, recursion is not the simple repetition of a pattern or item on single level (e.g., computer folders or Russian dolls side by side), but the placement of a pattern or item within itself (e.g., computer folders or Russian dolls inside each other), hence, generating different hierarchical levels or strata.

Annotations:
- [M2_S1a] Counter-claiming, theoretical (argument in previous research is problematic)

Sentence 6: This means that the same pattern or item is encountered at least at two different scales (e.g., 12 at the scale of hours, and 12 at the scale of minutes).

Annotations:
- [M2_S1a] Counter-claiming, theoretical (argument in previous research is problematic)

Sentence 7: In language, although classically associated with syntax (Chomsky, 2010; Idsardi et al., 2018), recursion and its diagnostic self-embedded patterns have been recognized in phonology (Bennett, 2018; Elfner, 2015; Kabak and Revithiadou, 2009; Nasukawa, 2015, 2020; Vogel, 2012), verbal and non-verbal music (Jackendoff, 2009; Koelsch et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2017; Sharma and Chimalakonda, 2018), making these systems open-ended and theoretically inexhaustible.

Annotations:
- [M1_S3] Reviewing a specific previous research study

Sentence 8: Recursive vocal sequences or structures in nonhuman primates could potentially inform insipient or transitional states of recursion along human evolution before the rise of modern language.

Annotations:
- [M2_S1b] Indicating a gap in previous research

Sentence 9: Their apparent absence, notably in great apes – our closest living relatives – has been interpreted as indicating that a neuro-cognitive or neuro-computational transformation occurred in our lineage but none other (Hauser et al., 2002).

Annotations:
- [M2_S1e] Pointing out limitations of previous research (something hasn’t been done)

Sentence 10: Decades-long debates on the evolution of language have carved around the successes and limitations of empirical comparative animal research (Bolhuis et al., 2018; Bowling and Fitch, 2015; Corballis and Corballis, 2014; Lameira, 2017; Lameira and Call, 2020; Martins and Boeckx, 2019; Rawski et al., 2021; Townsend et al., 2018).

Annotations:
- [M1_S3] Reviewing a specific previous research study

Sentence 11: Syntax-like vocal combinatorics have been identified in some bird (Engesser et al., 2019, 2016; Suzuki et al., 2016, 2017) and primate species (Jiang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2020), but vocal combinatorics were not claimed to be recursive nor was recursion directly tested.
