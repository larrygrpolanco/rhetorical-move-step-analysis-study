[1c] Among the many definitions of recursion (Martins, 2012), the view that it represents the repetition of an element or pattern within a self-similar element or pattern has crossed centuries and disciplines, from von Humboldt (1836) and Hockett (1960), to Mandelbrot (1980) and Chomsky (2010); from fractals in mathematics (Mandelbrot, 1980) to generative grammars in linguistics (Chomsky, 2010), from graphic (e.g., “Print Gallery” by M. C. Escher) to popular art (e.g., 1940’s Batman #8 comic book cover).
[2b] Indicating a gap in previous research [2c] Across varying terminologies, the common denominator across fields is that to re-curse (from the Latin to ‘re-run’ or ‘re-invoke’) is an operation that produces multiple, potentially infinite sets of items from one initial item or a finite set.
[3a] Outlining purposes of the present research [3b] This is achieved by nesting an item within itself or within another item of the same kind.
[2b] Indicating a gap in previous research [2d] Recursive patterns in everyday life are ubiquitous and include, for example, computer folders stored inside other computer folders, Russian dolls nested in each other, Romanesco broccoli’s spirals arranged in a spiral, and the same number of minutes passed within the same number of hours (e.g., 12:12).
[2b] Indicating a gap in previous research [2d] Accordingly, recursion is not the simple repetition of a pattern or item on a single level (e.g., computer folders or Russian dolls side by side), but the placement of a pattern or item within itself (e.g., computer folders or Russian dolls inside each other), hence, generating different hierarchical levels or strata.
[2b] Indicating a gap in previous research [2c] This means that the same pattern or item is encountered at least at two different scales (e.g., 12 at the scale of hours, and 12 at the scale of minutes).

[1a] Claiming centrality or value of the research area [2d] In language, although classically associated with syntax (Chomsky, 2010; Idsardi et al., 2018), recursion and its diagnostic self-embedded patterns have been recognized in phonology (Bennett, 2018; Elfner, 2015; Kabak and Revithiadou, 2009; Nasukawa, 2015, 2020; Vogel, 2012), verbal and non-verbal music (Jackendoff, 2009; Koelsch et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2017; Sharma and Chimalakonda, 2018), making these systems open-ended and theoretically inexhaustible.
