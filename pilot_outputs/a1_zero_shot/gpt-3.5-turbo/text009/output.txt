[1a] The daily rhythmicity of light and darkness serves most animals for the perception of time.
[1c] The behavioral responses to the phases of daylight and darkness depend on the animal’s visual system, its way of life (diurnal, nocturnal, or crepuscular), and the specific nature of the stimulus.
[1c] ALAN disrupts the natural light-dark cycle, impacting animals’ daily activity patterns and altering their temporal synchronization.
[1c] ALAN has been shown to have severe effects on human health, on wildlife, and on the environment.
[2a] In insects, nocturnal illumination has been reported to induce spatial disorientation, resulting in higher predation risk, increased mortality, reduced pollination, and collectively impeding biodiversity.
[3a] Our experimental model, the field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, is a ground-dwelling species exhibiting distinct diel stridulation and locomotion cycles.
[3c] We investigated the impact of ALAN on these nocturnal insects in a semi-natural experimental set-up.
[3c] Our findings have uncovered the effects of ecologically-relevant ALAN intensities on behavioral patterns of these insects, under such natural conditions.
