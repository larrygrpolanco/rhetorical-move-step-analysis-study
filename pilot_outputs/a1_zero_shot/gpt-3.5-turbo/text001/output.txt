Central components of animal cognition are their ability to adapt to new environmental conditions, store successful changes of their behavior caused by new learning, and use the relevant memories for further behavioral control. [M1_S1a] [M1_S2]  
In honeybees, a classical model of learning and memory studies, a large body of data document how cognitive functions are essential for their foraging success and survival of their colonies [1] [2]. [M1_S3]  
Evolutionary selections for the improvements of cognitive abilities work on the individual level and are based on genetic variations that are favorable for behavioral traits related to sensory processing, learning and memory formation [3] [4]. [M1_S1b]  
The search for such cognitive adaptations can be performed both on a population level and on an individual level. [M2_S2]  
However, little efforts have been concentrated on the study of the causes and lifestyle-related effects of individual variations in cognitive abilities and styles within single species [5] except for humans [6] [7] [8]. [M2_S1b]  
Studies across different vertebrate species although recognized the consistency of inter-individual variability in cognitive capacities ([9] [10] [11]), albeit tracing invertebrate cognition through the lens of individual behavioral variability is a much less explored. [M2_S1a] [M2_S1d]  
Selection for behavioral traits usually involve many animals.  
Studies on learning and memory in Drosophila have led to the discovery of multiple genes related to learning and memory and groups of flies belonging to the same line can be tested sequentially for the behavioral expression of learning and memory related performances [12]. [M3_S4a]  
However, the olfactory conditioning procedures engage usually many individuals at the same time e.g. in the T-maze paradigm ([13]), which makes it impossible to relate individual performances to their corresponding gene expression patterns. [M3_S4b]  
Olfactory conditioning protocols in Drosophila used by others also failed to decipher the heterogeneity in the expression of learned behavior among the individuals, rather the results were interpreted as the expression of probabilistic behavior at the individual level [14] [15]. [M2_S1e]  
Honeybees, on the other hand, can be selected for fast learning and then selectively bred via the thelytokous development of Apis mellifera capensis [16]; a highly effective procedure that should be applied more frequently. [M1_S1a]  
Tait and colleagues [17] tested individual honeybees in associative acquisition, non-associative sensitization, and short-term memory, and constructed a general heritable factor similar to factors derived for mammals [18] [19] [20]. [M3_S2a]  
The aim of our study was to investigate the behavioral heterogeneity and whether it is associated with gene expression in the brain of the honeybee. [M3_S1]
