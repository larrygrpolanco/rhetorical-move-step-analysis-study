[1a] Conserving global biodiversity in the Anthropocene requires a deep understanding of the factors that contribute to the resilience and growth of wildlife populations.
[1b] The suite of biotic and abiotic conditions that can contribute to population growth, from ambient conditions like temperature (Woodworth et al., 2017), humidity (Lu and Wu, 2011), or precipitation (Masó et al., 2020), to community-level factors like predator density (Salo et al., 2010), competitor density (Gamelon et al., 2019), or pathogen prevalence (Hoyt et al., 2020), can further serve as targets for conservation and management.
[1c] However, novel stressors such as climate change (Acevedo et al., 2020; Şekercioĝlu et al., 2012; Van Dyck et al., 2015), invasive species introduction (Hagman et al., 2009), and habitat fragmentation and loss (Haddad et al., 2015; Mantyka-Pringle et al., 2015) can alter associations between biotic and abiotic conditions and population growth or stability.
[2c] The form and magnitude of these altered associations is often ambiguous or difficult to characterize and can create the potential for a mismatch between conservation interventions and intended outcomes, possibly with negative effects on the targeted population (Sutherland et al., 2004).
[3a] Therefore, understanding how novel stressors change the way wildlife populations respond to biotic and abiotic conditions will be essential to their successful conservation in a rapidly changing world.
[1c] Emerging infectious diseases are one of many stressors that threaten wildlife populations and can result in host species declines or population extirpations (Altizer et al., 2013; Anderson et al., 2004; Daszak et al., 2001, 2000; Fisher et al., 2012; Rogalski et al., 2017), as evidenced by West Nile Virus and avian malaria in birds (Kilpatrick, 2011; Van Riper III et al., 1986), chytridiomycosis in amphibians (Skerratt et al., 2007), snake fungal disease (Lorch et al., 2016), sarcoptic mange in wombats (Martin et al., 2018), facial tumor disease in Tasmanian devils (Mccallum, 2008), and white-nose syndrome in bats (Hoyt et al., 2021).
[1c] Early conservation measures to bolster the demographic resilience and adaptability of host populations might dampen the impact of disease following its arrival (Grant et al., 2017; Hodgson et al., 2015).
[2c] However, it is often unclear whether those same conservation measures will promote the persistence of the host population during pathogen invasion when pathogen transmission dynamics (Huang et al., 2021; Leach et al., 2016) or environmental dependence of disease (Langwig et al., 2012; McNew et al., 2019; Samuel et al., 2015) can significantly shift the fitness landscape of the host.
[3a] This information is particularly important for rare and endangered host species with limited habitat availability or population sizes before pathogen invasion, as their sensitivity to novel stressors and management interventions necessitates unequivocal conservation best practices.
[1b] The size of a host population can contribute to its response to pathogen invasion and ultimately its risk of extirpation.
[1c] Greater standing genetic diversity in large host populations may promote evolutionary adaptation to an invading pathogen before total population collapse occurs (Barrett and Schluter, 2008; Bell, 2013; Carlson et al., 2014; Gomulkiewicz and Holt, 1995; Maslo and Fefferman, 2015).
[1c] Large populations also have less risk of stochastic fadeout, which can be exacerbated in populations declining from disease (de Castro and Bolker, 2005; Frick et al., 2015; Langwig et al., 2012).
[1c] However, if large populations also have high host densities, pathogen transmission may be elevated, leading to more rapid declines and greater extinction risk (Brunner et al., 2017; Cross et al., 2010; Cunningham et al., 2021; Rachowicz and Briggs, 2007; Smith et al., 2009; Storm et al., 2013).
[2b] While there are clear theoretical mechanisms of how host population size can contribute to its response to an emerging infectious disease, this association is often left uncharacterized due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data, despite being essential to prioritizing populations for conservation action.
[1c] Environmental dependence of pathogen transmission or disease severity can create both hotspots (Lambin et al., 2010; Ostfeld et al., 2005; Paull et al., 2012) or refugia from (Heard et al., 2015; Mosher et al., 2018; Puschendorf et al., 2011; Scheele et al., 2017; Spitzen-Van Der Sluijs et al., 2017) infection and disease.
[1c] Temperature, for example, can have complex effects on disease by influencing pathogen growth rates (Hopkins et al., 2021), pathogen transmission (Mordecai et al., 2019), host susceptibility to infection (Cohen et al., 2017), or disease severity following infection (Debes et al., 2017), processes that scale up to variation in population-level impacts on the host.
[1c] These environmental effects can further exacerbate impacts to host populations if high-quality habitat prior to pathogen invasion becomes population sinks or ecological traps of high pathogen transmission and disease severity following disease emergence (Hopkins et al., 2021; Leach et al., 2016).
[3a] Understanding environmental contributions to host population response offers a point of leverage for conservation efforts, as protection and enhancement of critical environmental conditions is fundamental to the conservation of threatened host species.
[3a] Importantly, environmental associations need not take the same form both pre- and post-pathogen arrival, and effective approaches to host species conservation must incorporate these dynamic processes.
[1c] White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease of hibernating bats caused by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Lorch et al., 2011; Minnis and Lindner, 2013; Warnecke et al., 2012).
[1c] The pathogen was introduced to North America in the early 2000s from its origin in Eurasia and has since spread widely through naïve hibernating bat populations (Blehert et al., 2009; Drees et al., 2017; Leopardi et al., 2015), causing severe population declines (Frick et al., 2015; Hoyt et al., 2021; Langwig et al., 2016, 2012).
[1c] Pseudogymnoascus destructans establishes an environmental pathogen reservoir within winter hibernacula (Hoyt et al., 2020, 2015; Laggan et al., 2023), the caves and mines where bats hibernate, and can persist for years in the absence of its host (Hoyt et al., 2015).
[1c] This results in seasonal infection dynamics in which WNS prevalence increases as bats arrive in hibernacula in late fall but declines during spring and summer months when bats do not primarily use hibernacula for roosting and bats are often euthermic (Langwig et al., 2015).
[1c] Infection severity increases over the winter hibernation period when body temperatures drop to approximately ambient conditions (Langwig et al., 2017, 2015), allowing the cold-adapted fungus to invade the epidermal tissue (Lorch et al., 2011; Warnecke et al., 2013).
[1c] Infection with P. destructans is accompanied by a suite of physiological changes that lead to dehydration (Cryan et al., 2013; Mcguire et al., 2017; Verant et al., 2014), frequent arousals from torpor (Lilley et al., 2016; Reeder et al., 2012; Warnecke et al., 2012), emaciation, and ultimately mortality (Cryan et al., 2010; Warnecke et al., 2013).
[1c] The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) is a North American species that has experienced severe but variable population declines due to WNS (Langwig et al., 2012; Thogmartin et al., 2012).
[2b] Despite its status as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, little is known about drivers of variation in Indiana bat declines and persistence with disease, information important for its conservation.
[1c] Environmental correlates of disease severity and population response have been previously reported for other species, particularly the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), where warmer hibernacula are associated with severe disease and declines (Grieneisen et al., 2015; Grimaudo et al., 2022; Hopkins et al., 2021; Langwig et al., 2016, 2012; Lilley et al., 2018), likely due to enhanced pathogen growth under those conditions (Marroquin et al., 2017; Verant et al., 2012).
[1c] However, previous work has not found a clear association between temperature conditions of hibernacula and the response of Indiana bat colonies (Langwig et al., 2012).
[1c] Evidence additionally suggests that for many species impacted by WNS, colony size may be related to the initial population response to the disease (Frick et al., 2015; Langwig et al., 2012).
[1c] However, the particularly gregarious nature and large cluster sizes of Indiana bats (Clawson et al., 1980; Hardin and Hassell, 1970; Thomson, 1982) may result in constant density across colony sizes and time, keeping pathogen transmission and declines high regardless of colony size.
[3b] In this study, we pair an extensive bat population dataset curated by the U.S..
[3b] Fish and Wildlife Service with a hibernacula environmental dataset to identify potential contributions of host population size and environmental conditions to Indiana bat population trends prior, during, and after pathogen arrival.
[3c] Our data provide information on how population-level processes and variation in environmental conditions can generate heterogeneous host population responses to novel infectious diseases, lending insights into how to successfully manage their impacts.
