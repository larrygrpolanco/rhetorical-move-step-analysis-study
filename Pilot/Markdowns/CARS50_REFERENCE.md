# CaRS-50 Quick Reference

## Annotation Scheme

### Move 1: Establishing a research territory
- **1a** = Claim centrality / value
- **1b** = Make generalizations (no specific studies)
- **1c** = Review specific studies (has citations/names)

### Move 2: Establishing a niche  
- **2a** = Counter-claim (challenge prior work)
- **2b** = Gap (something missing)
- **2c** = Question (something unclear)
- **2d** = Continue tradition (build on prior work)

### Move 3: Presenting present work
- **3a** = Purpose / aims
- **3b** = Describe methods/approach
- **3c** = Announce results/findings
- **3d** = Paper structure ("Section 2...")

## Quick Decision Tree

**Is it about prior research or present study?**
- Prior → Move 1 or 2
- Present → Move 3

**If prior research:**
- Just background → **1b**
- Specific study → **1c**
- Importance claim → **1a**
- Problem/gap → **2a/2b/2c**
- Building on it → **2d**

**If present study:**
- Goals/aims → **3a**
- What we did → **3b**
- What we found → **3c**
- Paper outline → **3d**

## Example Sentences

| Code | Example |
|------|---------|
| 1a | "Circadian rhythms have attracted considerable interest" |
| 1b | "Photosynthetic processes are well-documented across plants" |
| 1c | "Recent studies by Smith et al. (2021) explored chloroplast biogenesis" |
| 2a | "However, the link between light and roots remains disputed" |
| 2b | "Few studies have examined non-flowering plants" |
| 2c | "It remains unclear whether mechanisms are conserved" |
| 2d | "Following earlier work by Lee et al., we examine..." |
| 3a | "This study aims to investigate genetic basis of adaptation" |
| 3b | "We conducted comparative genomic analysis of..." |
| 3c | "Our results reveal strong correlation between X and Y" |
| 3d | "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2..." |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **1b vs 1c confusion**: 
- 1b = general statements about the field
- 1c = discussing a specific study (look for names/citations)

❌ **2b vs 2c confusion**:
- 2b = "Few studies have..." (clear gap)
- 2c = "It is unclear whether..." (question/uncertainty)

❌ **3a vs 3b confusion**:
- 3a = "We aim to..." (purpose)
- 3b = "We analyzed..." (methods/actions)

## Multi-Tagging Rules

**Rare but possible**: Some sentences perform multiple functions

Format: `1a, 3b` (comma-separated)

Evaluation rule: Correct if ANY predicted tag matches ANY gold tag
