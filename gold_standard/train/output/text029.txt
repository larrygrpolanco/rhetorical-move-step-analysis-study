[1a] SARS-CoV-2 is a persistent threat to global health and continued research is essential for the development of new vaccines and antivirals counteracting viral immune evasion and mutagenesis.
[1b] Viral assembly is a critical step in its life cycle and potential target for therapeutic development, but so far only incompletely understood.
[1c] As observed in recent cyro-electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies, virions contain ≈38±10 ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) that condense the large viral genomic RNA (gRNA) like beads on a string (1, 2).
[1c] vRNPs have 14 -16 nm sized pillar-shaped structures, are heterogeneous, and are composed of nucleocapsid (N-)protein and RNA with unknown architecture and assembly pathway.
[1c] N-protein is a 419 aa protein highly expressed in infected cells, and besides its key role in vRNP formation it is highly multifunctional (3–5).
[1c] It consists in two folded domains, the NTD and CTD, which are linked and flanked by large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) termed N-arm, linker, and C-arm (6) (Figure 1A).
[1c] The NTD forms a nucleic acid (NA) binding site that is thought to harbor recognition mechanism of a packaging signal (7).
[1c] The CTD provides a high-affinity dimerization interface and also binds NA (6) (Figure 1B).
[1c] Ultra-weak protein-protein interactions allow N-protein to undergo liquid- liquid phase separation (LLPS), enhanced in the presence of NA, to form droplets of high macromolecular density (8–11), which are thought to facilitate the assembly of vRNPs (9, 11–13).
[1c] IDRs also play important roles in N-protein NA interactions (14–17).
[1c] For example, the N-arm undergoes conformational changes upon NA binding to NTD, significantly increasing the affinity of the NTD for RNA (15).
[1c] Similar to the N-arm, an SR-rich portion of the linker IDR flanking the NTD is also perturbed by NA binding (14), as is an L-rich sequence of the linker IDR (LRS) further downstream.
[1c] Recently, we have shown that highly conserved transient helices in the LRS can assemble cooperatively into coiled-coil trimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers, in a process that is allosterically enhanced by NA binding (17, 18) (Figure 1C).
[1c] We hypothesized that this mechanism might initiate assembly by providing additional protein-protein interfaces essential for stabilizing three-dimensional structures of the vRNPs (17, 18).
[3a] To study the assembly mechanism in more detail we examine N-protein binding to short NA probes of sufficient length for multi-valent binding and ask how scaffolding N-protein might diminish or augment simultaneous LRS oligomerization.
[1c] As shown by Carlson and co-workers, mixtures of stem-loop RNA and N-protein form large RNA/protein complexes (RNPs) that may serve as a model for the viral vRNPs (11, 16).
[3b] In the current study, to further elucidate the assembly mechanism we utilize this system and compare the size distribution and composition of complexes formed by wildtype N-protein (NWT) or mutants that abrogate LRS oligomerization binding either short linear oligonucleotides or stem-loop RNA.
[3b] In parallel, we study the impact of the same mutations on viral packaging and assembly in a VLP assay.
[3b] Our data highlight the role of the LRS oligomerization and the interplay with nucleic acid binding of NTD and CTD in the formation of RNPs.
[3b] Taken together, these elements suggest features of possible RNP assembly models on the level of protein domains and their interfaces.
