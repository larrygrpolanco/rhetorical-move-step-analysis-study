[1c] Platelets play a pivotal role in primary hemostasis, thrombosis, inflammation, and vascular biology.
[1b] These anuclear discoid cells circulate in the bloodstream to patrol the integrity of the vascular system[1].
[1b] Upon injury, platelets quickly activate, change shape, release granule contents, and aggregate to form the hemostatic plug in the presence of fibrinogen.
[1b] Platelet activation can be triggered by many physiological agonists, including thrombin, the most potent platelet agonist and a key protease in coagulation[2,3].
[1c] Thrombin signals through two protease activated receptors (PARs), PAR1 and PAR4, on the surface of human platelets[4].
[1c] PARs belong to the GPCR superfamily and have a unique activation mechanism whereby the N-terminus is enzymatically cleaved to unmask the tethered ligand[5].
[1c] The new N-terminus interacts with the endogenous ligand binding site to induce a global structural rearrangement that activates downstream signaling[6,7].
[1c] PAR1 and PAR4 both signal through Gαq and Gα12/13, however with different kinetics[8].
[1c] PAR1 leads to rapid signaling that is quickly dissipated, whereas PAR4 leads to prolonged signaling[4,9,10].
[1c] This sustained signaling associated with PAR4 activation is essential for thrombosis, highlighting PAR4 as a promising target for antiplatelet therapies[11–13].
[1c] Over the past 10 years, platelet thrombin receptors have been appealing targets for antiplatelet therapies, which led to the first-in-class FDA approved PAR1 inhibitor, vorapaxar.
[2c] However, targeting PAR1 comes with a significant risk of bleeding, which outweighs its clinical benefits in preventing cardiovascular events[14,15].
[1c] In recent years, PAR4 has become a rising star as a safer antiplatelet and antithrombotic target for a number of reasons.
[1c] First, targeting PAR4 signaling without inhibiting PAR1 allows platelets to continue to respond to low levels of thrombin and preserves normal hemostasis[12].
[1c] Second, pharmacological inhibition of PAR4 prevents thrombin-mediated PAR4 activation at high concentrations that are associated with pathological thrombosis.
[1c] Third, since the prolonged signaling mediated by PAR4 activation is associated with factor V release from α-granules and microparticle generation[16], selectively inhibiting PAR4 would not only prevent thrombus formation but also reduce platelet procoagulant activity[11].
[1c] Collectively, this has culminated in the development of a number of PAR4 antagonists in the form of pepducins, small molecule compounds, and function-blocking antibodies[17].
[1c] Two small molecule PAR4 inhibitors from Bristol Myers Squibb, BMS-986120 and BMS-986141, were the subject of clinical trials and proved to be efficient in preventing cardiovascular events with a good safety profile[12,13,18].
[2d] PAR4’s unique properties have made it an attractive therapeutic target to prevent thrombosis without hindering normal hemostasis.
[3a] Therefore, it is essential that we fully understand the mechanisms underlying PAR4 signaling.
[1c] The tethered ligand mechanism was proposed in 1991 by Coughlin and colleagues, however the molecular mechanism of receptor activation is only recently understood.
[1c] Recently, we used amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/D exchange) mass spectrometry (MS) with purified full-length PAR4 to examine the conformational dynamics of the tethered ligand mechanism following activation by thrombin[19].
[3b] This study revealed that PAR4 activation requires a coordinated rearrangement of extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) and threonine at position 153 in the ligand binding site formed by transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and TM7.
[3b] Within ECL3, there is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in which the proline at 310 is replaced with a leucine (PAR4-310P/L, rs2227376).
[3b] This natural sequence variant of PAR4 had significantly lower receptor reactivity, as measured by calcium mobilization in HEK293 cells.
[1c] Natural sequence variants of PAR4 (e.g. rs773902 (PAR4-120A/T), and rs2227346 (PAR4-296F/V)) affect the receptor reactivity and subsequent platelet function [20–23].
[3b] Therefore, we hypothesize the hypo-reactive PAR4-P310L variant would reduce platelet responsiveness to thrombin stimulation
[3b] To test the impact of the PAR4-310P/L polymorphism in vivo, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a point mutation into PAR4 to generate the mouse homolog of this variant, PAR4-P322L.
[3c] PAR4-P322L significantly reduced platelet responsiveness to PAR4-activation peptide (AYPGKF) and thrombin, while ADP and GPVI signaling were not affected.
[3c] Further, platelet aggregation was dramatically decreased in the platelets from mice that carried one (PAR4P/L, heterozygous) or two (PAR4L/L, homozygous) alleles of PAR4-P322L.
[3c] Additionally, PAR4L/L mice displayed slightly extended tail bleeding compared to wild-types.
[3c] PAR4-P322L also delayed arterial occlusion in the ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis model.
