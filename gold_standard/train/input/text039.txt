Isoprene pyrophosphates are metabolites in the mevalonate pathway which is an essential metabolic pathway found in eukaryotes, archaea, and some prokaryotes [1] and is responsible for the multistep conversion of acetyl-CoA into isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP).
IPPP and DMAPP are used as building blocks in the biosynthesis of all mammalian isoprenoids.
In addition, IPPP and DMAPP are used to produce a diverse array of essential nonsterol and sterol biomolecules.
An example is cholesterol which is crucial for maintaining cell membrane integrity and used for production of steroid hormones and bile acids.
Other products derived from isoprene PPs are lipoproteins, vitamin K, heme A, the mitochondrial electron carrier ubiquinone, dolichol, and isopentenyladenine used in tRNA modification [1, 2].
Consequently, the isoprene PPs produced by the mevalonate pathway are crucial for a plethora of important biological processes.
Figure 1 shows the structures of the physiologically relevant isoprene pyrophosphates (isoprene PPs) in animals.
Moreover, approximately 2% of all mammalian proteins undergo post-translational isoprenylation [3].
This process involves the covalent attachment of hydrophobic C-15 isoprene farnesyl or the C-20 isoprene geranylgeranyl group to cysteine residues in the C-terminal end of various proteins.
Proteins that are farnesylated include the small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) exemplified by the Ras superfamily, whereas other small GTPases such as Rab and Rho GTPases are geranylgeranylated [4].
Prenylation of these proteins enables their attachment to cellular membranes, a prerequisite for these proteins to exert their specific functions in biological processes such as cell survival, cell signaling, and proliferation [5].
The dysregulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis has been implicated in several biochemical disorders, underscoring the crucial role of appropriate isoprenoid levels in maintaining proper cellular function [6–8].
Additionally, statins, commonly employed to reduce cholesterol levels, exhibit effects beyond cholesterol regulation likely mediated by changes in isoprene metabolite levels [9].
These statin-induced alterations impact fundamental processes such as cell cycle regulation, cell migration, cell proliferation and cell survival [7, 10].
Given the significance of isoprenoid metabolites, their levels are presumably tightly controlled.
Mevalonate kinase (MK), the second enzyme in the isoprene biosynthesis pathway, is subject to feedback inhibition by intermediates of the isoprenoid pathway - geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) [11].
Furthermore, HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in sterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, is regulated through a feedback loop to maintain cholesterol levels within appropriate ranges while nonsterol isoprenoids are still being produced.
Sterol molecules and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) participate in this feedback loop by promoting the proteasomal breakdown of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme [12].
In addition, geraniol (GOH) and farnesol (FOH) have been demonstrated to have inhibitory effects on HMG-CoA reductase activity [13–16].
How these isoprenoid alcohols are produced in human cells remains unclear, however, a membrane bound polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase (PDP1) has been suggested to be involved in this process [17, 18].
However, no cytosolic phosphatases capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of isoprene pyrophosphates have been identified to date.
Building upon the finding that the NUDIX enzyme NUDTX1 in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and rose (Rosa hybrid cultivar) can convert GPP to Geranyl monophosphate (GP) [19, 20], we hypothesized that enzymes within the human NUDIX enzyme family might possess the capability to hydrolyze isoprene pyrophosphates in the cell.
To investigate this, we screened a panel of human NUDIX enzymes for activity with the isoprene pyrophosphates IPPP and DMAPP and found NUDT15 and NUDT18 to efficiently catalyze their hydrolysis.
Moreover, we identified additional isoprene PPs as substrates of NUDT15 and NUDT18 of which GPP was found to be hydrolyzed with the highest catalytic efficiency.
Notably, we showed that overexpression of NUDT15 and NUDT18 resulted in decreased cellular cholesterol content indicating that their activity with isoprene PPs plays a role in a cellular context.
In summary, our findings unveil previously unknown hydrolysis activities of NUDT18 and NUDT15 with endogenous isoprene pyrophosphate substrates, suggesting a novel role for these enzymes in isoprene PP metabolism.
