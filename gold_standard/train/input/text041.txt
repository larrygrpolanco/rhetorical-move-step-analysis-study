Platelets play a pivotal role in primary hemostasis, thrombosis, inflammation, and vascular biology.
These anuclear discoid cells circulate in the bloodstream to patrol the integrity of the vascular system[1].
Upon injury, platelets quickly activate, change shape, release granule contents, and aggregate to form the hemostatic plug in the presence of fibrinogen.
Platelet activation can be triggered by many physiological agonists, including thrombin, the most potent platelet agonist and a key protease in coagulation[2,3].
Thrombin signals through two protease activated receptors (PARs), PAR1 and PAR4, on the surface of human platelets[4].
PARs belong to the GPCR superfamily and have a unique activation mechanism whereby the N-terminus is enzymatically cleaved to unmask the tethered ligand[5].
The new N-terminus interacts with the endogenous ligand binding site to induce a global structural rearrangement that activates downstream signaling[6,7].
PAR1 and PAR4 both signal through Gαq and Gα12/13, however with different kinetics[8].
PAR1 leads to rapid signaling that is quickly dissipated, whereas PAR4 leads to prolonged signaling[4,9,10].
This sustained signaling associated with PAR4 activation is essential for thrombosis, highlighting PAR4 as a promising target for antiplatelet therapies[11–13].
Over the past 10 years, platelet thrombin receptors have been appealing targets for antiplatelet therapies, which led to the first-in-class FDA approved PAR1 inhibitor, vorapaxar.
However, targeting PAR1 comes with a significant risk of bleeding, which outweighs its clinical benefits in preventing cardiovascular events[14,15].
In recent years, PAR4 has become a rising star as a safer antiplatelet and antithrombotic target for a number of reasons.
First, targeting PAR4 signaling without inhibiting PAR1 allows platelets to continue to respond to low levels of thrombin and preserves normal hemostasis[12].
Second, pharmacological inhibition of PAR4 prevents thrombin-mediated PAR4 activation at high concentrations that are associated with pathological thrombosis.
Third, since the prolonged signaling mediated by PAR4 activation is associated with factor V release from α-granules and microparticle generation[16], selectively inhibiting PAR4 would not only prevent thrombus formation but also reduce platelet procoagulant activity[11].
Collectively, this has culminated in the development of a number of PAR4 antagonists in the form of pepducins, small molecule compounds, and function-blocking antibodies[17].
Two small molecule PAR4 inhibitors from Bristol Myers Squibb, BMS-986120 and BMS-986141, were the subject of clinical trials and proved to be efficient in preventing cardiovascular events with a good safety profile[12,13,18].
PAR4’s unique properties have made it an attractive therapeutic target to prevent thrombosis without hindering normal hemostasis.
Therefore, it is essential that we fully understand the mechanisms underlying PAR4 signaling.
The tethered ligand mechanism was proposed in 1991 by Coughlin and colleagues, however the molecular mechanism of receptor activation is only recently understood.
Recently, we used amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/D exchange) mass spectrometry (MS) with purified full-length PAR4 to examine the conformational dynamics of the tethered ligand mechanism following activation by thrombin[19].
This study revealed that PAR4 activation requires a coordinated rearrangement of extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) and threonine at position 153 in the ligand binding site formed by transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and TM7.
Within ECL3, there is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in which the proline at 310 is replaced with a leucine (PAR4-310P/L, rs2227376).
This natural sequence variant of PAR4 had significantly lower receptor reactivity, as measured by calcium mobilization in HEK293 cells.
Natural sequence variants of PAR4 (e.g. rs773902 (PAR4-120A/T), and rs2227346 (PAR4-296F/V)) affect the receptor reactivity and subsequent platelet function [20–23].
Therefore, we hypothesize the hypo-reactive PAR4-P310L variant would reduce platelet responsiveness to thrombin stimulation
To test the impact of the PAR4-310P/L polymorphism in vivo, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a point mutation into PAR4 to generate the mouse homolog of this variant, PAR4-P322L.
PAR4-P322L significantly reduced platelet responsiveness to PAR4-activation peptide (AYPGKF) and thrombin, while ADP and GPVI signaling were not affected.
Further, platelet aggregation was dramatically decreased in the platelets from mice that carried one (PAR4P/L, heterozygous) or two (PAR4L/L, homozygous) alleles of PAR4-P322L.
Additionally, PAR4L/L mice displayed slightly extended tail bleeding compared to wild-types.
PAR4-P322L also delayed arterial occlusion in the ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis model.
