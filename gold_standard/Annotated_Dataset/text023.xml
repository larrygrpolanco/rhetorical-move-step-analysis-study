        <text>The spontaneous movement of polar lipids from one side of a membrane bilayer to the other is slow and is accelerated in cells to a physiologically relevant rate by lipid transporters [1,2].</text>

        <step>1a</step>
        <text>Flippases and floppases are transporters which move lipids unidirectionally, against their concentration gradient in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas scramblases enable bidirectional lipid movement without need of metabolic energy.</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>Scramblases typically possess transmembrane helices that are not fully hydrophobic.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s004</sentenceID>
        <step>1b</step>
        <text>These helices form a membrane-spanning hydrophilic groove along which phospholipids can move in analogy to a credit card (phospholipid) being swiped through a card reader (scramblase) [1].</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s005</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Known scramblases are alpha-helical proteins[3–6], but recently, a beta-barrel scramblase, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), was identified[7].</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s006</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>The VDAC barrel has membrane-facing polar residues that, when paired with the same residues in a second beta barrel at a dimer interface, create a local membrane defect along which lipids cross the membrane in credit card mode.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s007</sentenceID>
        <step>1a</step>
        <text>Therefore, the presence or ability to form a hydrophilic groove across the membrane seems to be a common feature for lipid scrambling.</text>

        <text>Insertases assist in the integration of membrane proteins into lipid bilayers[8].</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s009</sentenceID>
        <step>1a</step>
        <text>Their activity is necessary because membrane proteins typically have hydrophilic segments that do not spontaneously insert into the membrane.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s010</sentenceID>
        <step>1b</step>
        <text>The translocating moieties of these proteins are thus amphiphilic, similar to lipids, and it is interesting to consider whether insertases and scramblases may share a common mechanism even though lipids and their polar headgroups are generally smaller than the translocating parts of membrane proteins.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s011</sentenceID>
        <step>1b</step>
        <text>In fact, it has been suggested that scramblases, insertases, and some translocases may facilitate the insertion and translocation of phospholipids and proteins through membrane thinning[9].</text>

        <text>Recent work demonstrated that the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2 is an insertase[10].</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s013</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>MTCH2 has a wide transbilayer groove lined with polar and charged residues, reminiscent of the hydrophilic grooves of scramblases, leading us to hypothesize that it may function as a scramblase.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s014</sentenceID>
        <step>3a</step>
        <text>To test this hypothesis, we performed coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MTCH2 in a model lipid bilayer.</text>
      </sentence>
      <sentence>
        <sentenceID>t023s015</sentenceID>
        <step>3b</step>
        <text>We show that MTCH2 is indeed a scramblase, with the hydrophilic groove providing a transbilayer path for the movement of lipid headgroups while the acyl chains move through the hydrophobic interior of the membrane in credit card mode.</text>
