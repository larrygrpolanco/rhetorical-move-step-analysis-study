        <text>β-lactams, including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, are the most commonly used antibiotics that irreversibly inhibit enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis. [1]</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>As a result of persistent exposure to β-lactams and the imposed survival pressure, bacteria continually evolve to evade therapeutic action, predominantly via the production of β-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria. [2–5] </text>

        <text>β-Lactamases, categorized into classes A, B, C, and D,[6] can degrade all classes of β-lactam drugs and thus present a global clinical threat in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). [7,8]</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>To combat the ever-increasing AMR, the use of β-lactamase inhibitors-clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam that share the β-lactam backbone, were clinically approved in combination with specific β-lactam drugs. [9]</text>

        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Efforts to restore activity against these diverse enzymes led to the clinical approval of a non-β-lactam (diazabicyclooctane) β-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam. [11]</text>

        <sentenceID>t022s007</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Unlike the first three clinical inhibitors that are limited in their activity only to class A β-lactamases, avibactam is a broad-spectrum inhibitor for serine (class A, C, and some class D) enzymes. [8,12]</text>

        <text>The combination of avibactam with an oxyimino-cephalosporin, ceftazidime, appeared as a salvage therapy for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections primarily caused by KPC-producing bacteria. [13]</text>

        <text>However, a site-directed mutagenesis study revealed ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) resistance in KPC-2 variants with substitutions at R164 and D179 positions of the omega loop. [14,15]</text>

        <text>Due to the buried conformation of D179, variants at this position produce a more pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop compared to R164 mutants, where the crystallographic structure remains mostly intact. [30,40]</text>
