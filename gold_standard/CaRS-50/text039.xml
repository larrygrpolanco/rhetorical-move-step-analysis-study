        <text>Isoprene pyrophosphates are metabolites in the mevalonate pathway which is an essential metabolic pathway found in eukaryotes, archaea, and some prokaryotes [1] and is responsible for the multistep conversion of acetyl-CoA into isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP).</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>This process involves the covalent attachment of hydrophobic C-15 isoprene farnesyl or the C-20 isoprene geranylgeranyl group to cysteine residues in the C-terminal end of various proteins.</text>

        <step>1b</step>
        <text>Proteins that are farnesylated include the small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) exemplified by the Ras superfamily, whereas other small GTPases such as Rab and Rho GTPases are geranylgeranylated [4].</text>

        <text>Mevalonate kinase (MK), the second enzyme in the isoprene biosynthesis pathway, is subject to feedback inhibition by intermediates of the isoprenoid pathway - geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) [11].</text>

        <text>Furthermore, HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in sterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, is regulated through a feedback loop to maintain cholesterol levels within appropriate ranges while nonsterol isoprenoids are still being produced.</text>

        <sentenceID>t039s018</sentenceID>
        <step>1c</step>
        <text>Sterol molecules and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) participate in this feedback loop by promoting the proteasomal breakdown of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme [12].</text>

        <text>How these isoprenoid alcohols are produced in human cells remains unclear, however, a membrane bound polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase (PDP1) has been suggested to be involved in this process [17, 18].</text>

        <step>3a</step>
        <text>Building upon the finding that the NUDIX enzyme NUDTX1 in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and rose (Rosa hybrid cultivar) can convert GPP to Geranyl monophosphate (GP) [19, 20], we hypothesized that enzymes within the human NUDIX enzyme family might possess the capability to hydrolyze isoprene pyrophosphates in the cell.</text>

        <sentenceID>t039s024</sentenceID>
        <step>3c</step>
        <text>Moreover, we identified additional isoprene PPs as substrates of NUDT15 and NUDT18 of which GPP was found to be hydrolyzed with the highest catalytic efficiency.</text>

        <sentenceID>t039s025</sentenceID>
        <step>3c</step>
        <text>Notably, we showed that overexpression of NUDT15 and NUDT18 resulted in decreased cellular cholesterol content indicating that their activity with isoprene PPs plays a role in a cellular context.</text>
