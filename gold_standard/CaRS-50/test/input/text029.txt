SARS-CoV-2 is a persistent threat to global health and continued research is essential for the development of new vaccines and antivirals counteracting viral immune evasion and mutagenesis.
Viral assembly is a critical step in its life cycle and potential target for therapeutic development, but so far only incompletely understood.
As observed in recent cyro-electron tomography (cryo-ET) studies, virions contain ≈38±10 ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) that condense the large viral genomic RNA (gRNA) like beads on a string (1, 2).
vRNPs have 14 -16 nm sized pillar-shaped structures, are heterogeneous, and are composed of nucleocapsid (N-)protein and RNA with unknown architecture and assembly pathway.
N-protein is a 419 aa protein highly expressed in infected cells, and besides its key role in vRNP formation it is highly multifunctional (3–5).
It consists in two folded domains, the NTD and CTD, which are linked and flanked by large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) termed N-arm, linker, and C-arm (6) (Figure 1A).
The NTD forms a nucleic acid (NA) binding site that is thought to harbor recognition mechanism of a packaging signal (7).
The CTD provides a high-affinity dimerization interface and also binds NA (6) (Figure 1B).
Ultra-weak protein-protein interactions allow N-protein to undergo liquid- liquid phase separation (LLPS), enhanced in the presence of NA, to form droplets of high macromolecular density (8–11), which are thought to facilitate the assembly of vRNPs (9, 11–13).
IDRs also play important roles in N-protein NA interactions (14–17).
For example, the N-arm undergoes conformational changes upon NA binding to NTD, significantly increasing the affinity of the NTD for RNA (15).
Similar to the N-arm, an SR-rich portion of the linker IDR flanking the NTD is also perturbed by NA binding (14), as is an L-rich sequence of the linker IDR (LRS) further downstream.
Recently, we have shown that highly conserved transient helices in the LRS can assemble cooperatively into coiled-coil trimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers, in a process that is allosterically enhanced by NA binding (17, 18) (Figure 1C).
We hypothesized that this mechanism might initiate assembly by providing additional protein-protein interfaces essential for stabilizing three-dimensional structures of the vRNPs (17, 18).
To study the assembly mechanism in more detail we examine N-protein binding to short NA probes of sufficient length for multi-valent binding and ask how scaffolding N-protein might diminish or augment simultaneous LRS oligomerization.
As shown by Carlson and co-workers, mixtures of stem-loop RNA and N-protein form large RNA/protein complexes (RNPs) that may serve as a model for the viral vRNPs (11, 16).
In the current study, to further elucidate the assembly mechanism we utilize this system and compare the size distribution and composition of complexes formed by wildtype N-protein (NWT) or mutants that abrogate LRS oligomerization binding either short linear oligonucleotides or stem-loop RNA.
In parallel, we study the impact of the same mutations on viral packaging and assembly in a VLP assay.
Our data highlight the role of the LRS oligomerization and the interplay with nucleic acid binding of NTD and CTD in the formation of RNPs.
Taken together, these elements suggest features of possible RNP assembly models on the level of protein domains and their interfaces.
