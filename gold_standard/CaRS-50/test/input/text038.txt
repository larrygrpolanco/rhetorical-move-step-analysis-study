Human primase/polymerase PrimPol was first identified in 2005 and characterized in 2013 (Iyer et al. 2005; García-Gómez et al. 2013; Wan et al. 2013; Bianchi et al. 2013).
PrimPol belongs to the superfamily of archaeo-eukaryotic primases (AEPs) and possesses DNA-primase and DNA-polymerase activities.
Unlike human replicative primase (PriS/PriL), which synthesizes RNA-primers, PrimPol preferably synthesizes de novo DNA-primers using deoxyribonucleotides and starting with initiating ATP ribonucleotide (Martínez-Jiménez et al. 2018).
PrimPol is present in both the nucleus and mitochondria and plays an important role in maintaining stability of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (García-Gómez et al. 2013; Keen, Jozwiakowski, et al. 2014; Mourón et al. 2013).
It is assumed that the main function of PrimPol is the restart of DNA synthesis at the sites of blocking DNA damage or secondary DNA structures such as bulky DNA lesions (Piberger et al. 2020), DNA-crosslinks (González-Acosta et al. 2021), G-quadruplexes (Schiavone et al. 2016; T. Li et al. 2023; Butler et al. 2020), R-loops (Šviković et al. 2019).
PrimPol is also capable of translesion DNA synthesis and bypasses a number of DNA lesions by direct insertion of nucleotides opposite DNA lesions as well as «skipping» damaged nucleotides (Makarova et al. 2018; E. Boldinova et al. 2022; Stojkovic et al. 2016; García-Gómez et al. 2013; Bianchi et al. 2013; Martínez-Jiménez et al. 2015).
Disfunction of PrimPol in the cell leads to slower replication and proliferation, accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei, defects in mitochondrial replication, and increased sensitivity of cells to DNA-damaging agents (Wan et al. 2013; Kobayashi et al. 2016; Bailey et al. 2016; Bailey, Bianchi, and Doherty 2019; Mourón et al. 2013).
It was suggested that disfunction of PrimPol contributes to the development of some human diseases, such as hereditary mitochondrial pathologies (e.g., ophthalmic diseases and even muscular dystrophies) (Kasamo et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2020).
Comprehensive bioinformatic pan-cancer analysis revealed that aberrant PRIMPOL expression or altered protein structure in different types of cancers possibly affect clinical prognosis, cell invasion and anti-tumor immune response (Deng et al. 2023).
According to the TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies (cBioPortal), 72 somatic mutations of PRIMPOL gene carrying 59 missense mutations were identified in cancer patients (Cerami et al. 2012).
Many mutations have potential to disrupt PrimPol activity since they affect the enzyme active site, binding sites for the PolDIP2 and RPA regulatory proteins, and ZnFn motif (Díaz-Talavera et al. 2022).
Several mutations were identified more than in one patient (R76C/H, L96I, N187H/I, K311I/P, P314H/S, E370G/Q, E407K, R417W/Q, Y521S) that makes them promising targets for future studies of association with the cancer risks and disease prognosis (Cerami et al. 2012).
Biochemical study of the properties of the identified PrimPol variants is just began and only few of them are properly characterized up to date.
The variants Y89D/N were identified in patients with hereditable high myopia and progressive external ophthalmoplegia as well as healthy individuals (Kasamo et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2020; Keen, Bailey, et al. 2014; J. Li and Zhang 2015).
These substitutions reduce affinity to DNA and dNTPs substrates and increase sensitivity of cells to UV radiation (Keen, Bailey, et al. 2014).
Several recent studies revealed new inherited autosomal dominant PrimPol mutant variants in patient with high myopia but their biochemical properties are yet to be described: T285A (Haarman et al. 2022), S330C and I369T (Yang et al. 2023).
Also a frameshift mutation (V131Gfs*6) resulting from duplication of c.391G of PRIMPOL gene was discovered in patients with high myopia in Asian populations (Cai et al. 2019).
The somatic variants F522V and I554T found in cancer patients are located in the RPA-binding domain of PrimPol and significantly reduce the ability of PrimPol to bind RPA in vitro (Guilliam et al. 2017).
The R417W and R417L somatic mutations found in tumors have been shown to greatly impair PrimPol primase activity (Díaz-Talavera 2020).
The somatic Y100H substitution detected in lung cancer samples increases rNTP incorporation due to loss of PrimPol ability to discriminate between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides but slightly decreases dNTP incorporation.
The Y100H variant effectively synthesizes DNA de novo as the wild-type PrimPol and is able to synthesize RNA primers.
It was suggested that enhanced ability of PrimPol Y100H variant to incorporate rNTPs can provide advantages to cancer cells at early stages of carcinogenesis (Díaz-Talavera et al. 2019).
In the present work, we functionally characterized a rare missense PrimPol variant V102A (c.305T>C; rs142122035) found in patients suffering from ovarian and cervical cancer.
This variant has been identified in human genome previously (rs142122035; MAF C=0.011223, a total allele frequency from dbGaP aggregated by ALFA) but was not reported as a clinically significant variant.
For comparison, we created two mutant PrimPol variants containing substitutions in the active site: D114E and L115M.
We provided molecular evidence that the Val102Ala substitution significantly alters the DNA-primase and DNA-polymerase activities of enzyme.
