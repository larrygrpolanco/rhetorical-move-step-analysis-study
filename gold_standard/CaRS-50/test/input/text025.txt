Biomolecular condensates serve as important mechanisms for the hierarchical and vectorial organization of chemistry within cells.[1–7]
They are non-stoichiometric assemblies of biomolecules that can form via spontaneous or driven processes and exhibit characteristics of phase separation and percolation [8–10].
The chemical environment and physicochemical conditions within condensates are distinct from their surroundings,[11–18] enabling cells to selectively partition biomolecules, prevent unwanted cross-talk and interference between various biochemical pathways, and buffer against chemical noise.
In recent years, these condensates have gained significant prominence and attracted substantial research interest.
They have been found to primarily form through the involvement of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) [19–22]. 
Multivalent interactions involve the binding of multiple partners simultaneously and are often nonspecific in nature, leading to the spontaneous aggregation and condensationof various cellular components.
These unique proteins lack a fixed threedimensional structure, enabling them to be highly flexible and engage in multivalent interactions.
Many research groups have attempted to establish what is known as the “molecular grammar”,[23–34] which connects amino acid sequences with protein phase behaviors and the collective physical properties of condensates.
Establishing a theoretical framework is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological condensates.
The “stickers and spacers” model, originally developed within the context of polymer gelation theory,35–37 has gained popularity for modeling protein condensates [1,2,25,38–40]. 
In this model, biomolecules within condensates are envisioned as possessing two distinct functional components: “stickers” and “spacers”.
Stickers represent specific molecular domains or motifs with a high affinity for one another, facilitating interaction and bringing molecules into close proximity, thereby contributing to the condensate’s cohesive and ordered structure.
Conversely, spacers act as flexible linkers connecting the stickers, enabling the dynamic and transient nature of interactions within the condensate.
This model offers a conceptual framework that assists in interpreting experimental observations regarding condensate stability and material properties [41].
The simplicity of the stickers and spacers model, crucial for its theoretical elegance, encounters limitations when applied to realistic biomolecules.
Specifically, when dealing with an IDP, the identification of stickers and spacers is often challenging [1,3,42,43]. 
Most amino acids undergo some level of interactions, and determining when to disregard these interactions to categorize them as spacers remains ambiguous.
We propose that instead of entirely disregarding their interactions, it’s essential to consider the interactions between spacer sequences and explore their impact on the physical properties of condensates.
This exploration could offer insights into the evolutionary pressure of IDP sequences, arising from the interplay between sticker and spacer sequences.
Moreover, such an investigation could enhance our understanding of real-world biological condensates, where spacers might deviate from ideal behavior but still participate in weak interactions.
We expanded the stickers and spacers model to include explicit non-specific pairwise interactions between spacers, alongside the specific interactions among sticker motifs.
This extension allowed us to systematically explore the intricate interplay between specific and non-specific interactions in determining the structural and compositional properties of condensates.
Our investigation revealed that spacer interactions contribute to phase separation and the co-condensation of multiple molecules.
However, the non-specific nature of these interactions results in disorganized condensates with undefined molecular compositions.
In contrast, specific sticker-sticker interactions drive the formation of condensates with robust contacts and precise compositions.
Subsequently, we discussed the implications of our theory for the evolution of protein sequences, asserting the existence of evolutionary constraints even on segments of protein sequences that interact non-specifically.
These constraints ensure the functionality of condensates.
This evolutionary pressure naturally favors the emergence of low complexity domains to suppress spurious interactions, facilitating the formation of biologically meaningful condensates.
