Cigarette smoking is the most preventable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the United States (1–3).
While smoking promotes the progression of coronary artery disease and increases the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, ischemia-induced arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (4–6), short-term secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure alone has been associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (7).
Although the mechanisms for this increased vulnerability to arrhythmias have yet to be fully explored, we have previously shown that the susceptibility to calcium (Ca2+) and action potential duration (APD) alternans was increased with SHS exposure (8).
At present, however, the contributions of individual cigarette smoke components to the increased emergence of alternans and arrhythmias is unknown.
Whereas cigarette usage has declined, sales of electronic (e)-cigarettes increased by 46.6% between 2020 – 2022 (9).
Though often considered less harmful than traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes also contain numerous chemicals including nicotine, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, aldehydes and flavors (10–13).
The amount of nicotine present in e- cigarettes is widely variable but, in some cases, has been reported to be higher than an entire pack of conventional cigarettes (14, 15).
Nicotine directly modulates autonomic control of the heart through its binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) found within the brain, adrenal medulla, and post ganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic and sympathetic cardiac nerves (16).
In studies using labeled norepinephrine (NE), rats given nicotine for 10 days had a higher NE but lower acetylcholine outflow in the hippocampus (16), indicating that the overall net effect from the central nervous system is sympathetically driven and that chronic nicotine exposure could lead to sympathetic hyperactivity.
Similarly, acute exposure to e- cigarettes containing nicotine has been linked to reduced heart rate variability (HRV) (17), which is typically associated with increased sympathetic activity and risk of sudden cardiac death (18, 19).
Thus, it is possible that long-term nicotine use results in autonomic dysregulation that may play a role in promoting ventricular arrhythmias.
In addition to its actions on the autonomic nervous system, nicotine also directly affects the myocardium, likely through its binding to non-neuronal nAChRs found on ventricular cardiac myocytes (20).
Acute nicotine administration has been shown to directly block the membrane stabilizing current Ik1 in isolated myocytes (21, 22) which we have previously demonstrated leads to the generation of ectopic beats in the intact heart (23).
Exposure to nicotine is also associated with increased myocardial fibrosis (24–26), which may play a role in creating a heterogeneous substrate that can foster ectopic activity and/or reentrant arrhythmias (27).
In line with these findings, in-vivo administration of nicotine was reported to result in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in a canine model of MI (28, 29), with meta-analysis studies also identifying increased risk of rhythm disorders in patients on nicotine replacement therapies (30, 31).
As such, at the level of the heart, nicotine exposure is associated with myocardial remodeling alongside alterations in autonomic regulation that appear to be synergistically proarrhythmic.
However, despite the importance of these findings, the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying increased arrhythmia susceptibility due to nicotine exposure are unclear.
Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic nicotine exposure on cardiac electrophysiology, Ca2+ handling, structure, and sympathetic responsiveness in the intact heart to elucidate potential mechanisms of increased arrhythmia risk.
