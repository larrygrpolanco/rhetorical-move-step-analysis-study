The spontaneous movement of polar lipids from one side of a membrane bilayer to the other is slow and is accelerated in cells to a physiologically relevant rate by lipid transporters [1,2].
Flippases and floppases are transporters which move lipids unidirectionally, against their concentration gradient in an ATP-dependent manner, whereas scramblases enable bidirectional lipid movement without need of metabolic energy.
Scramblases typically possess transmembrane helices that are not fully hydrophobic.
These helices form a membrane-spanning hydrophilic groove along which phospholipids can move in analogy to a credit card (phospholipid) being swiped through a card reader (scramblase) [1].
Known scramblases are alpha-helical proteins[3â€“6], but recently, a beta-barrel scramblase, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), was identified[7].
The VDAC barrel has membrane-facing polar residues that, when paired with the same residues in a second beta barrel at a dimer interface, create a local membrane defect along which lipids cross the membrane in credit card mode.
Therefore, the presence or ability to form a hydrophilic groove across the membrane seems to be a common feature for lipid scrambling.
Insertases assist in the integration of membrane proteins into lipid bilayers[8].
Their activity is necessary because membrane proteins typically have hydrophilic segments that do not spontaneously insert into the membrane.
The translocating moieties of these proteins are thus amphiphilic, similar to lipids, and it is interesting to consider whether insertases and scramblases may share a common mechanism even though lipids and their polar headgroups are generally smaller than the translocating parts of membrane proteins.
In fact, it has been suggested that scramblases, insertases, and some translocases may facilitate the insertion and translocation of phospholipids and proteins through membrane thinning[9].
Recent work demonstrated that the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2 is an insertase[10].
MTCH2 has a wide transbilayer groove lined with polar and charged residues, reminiscent of the hydrophilic grooves of scramblases, leading us to hypothesize that it may function as a scramblase.
To test this hypothesis, we performed coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of MTCH2 in a model lipid bilayer.
We show that MTCH2 is indeed a scramblase, with the hydrophilic groove providing a transbilayer path for the movement of lipid headgroups while the acyl chains move through the hydrophobic interior of the membrane in credit card mode.
