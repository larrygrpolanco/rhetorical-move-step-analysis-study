Neuropeptides, a diverse array of signaling molecules, orchestrate a multitude of physiological processes in organisms.
Among them, neuropeptides possessing the Arg-Phe-NH2 (RFamide) motif at their C-termini are designated as RFamide peptides and have attracted considerable attentions because of their pivotal roles in various biological functions [1–3].
The RF-amide family encompasses five distinct peptides: Neuropeptide FF (NPFF), Prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), Kisspeptin (Kiss1), gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), and pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (QRFP).
Each peptide interacts with specific class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiating a cascade of intracellular events to modulate physiological responses.
Similarly, the RY-amide peptides, characterized by the signature RY motif at their C-termini, present a similar mode of action, interacting with their respective receptors to regulate physiological processes [4].
This categorization based on the C-terminal residues highlights the specificity and diversity within these peptide families.
The intricate interplay between these peptides and their receptors represents a complex network critical for maintaining homeostasis and responding to environmental changes.
QRFP is a 43-amino acid RFamide peptide with a pyroglutamylated N-terminus (namely 43Rfa).
QRFP was originally identified by a bioinformatics approach and reverse pharmacology[5], and demonstrates specific activity for GPR103 with orexigenic activity[5–7], a Gq-coupled receptor expressed in the brain and adrenal gland.
GPR103 is predominantly localized in the central nervous system, including regions such as the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of energy metabolism and appetite control.
QRFP and GPR103 are implicated in a variety of physiological functions ranging from the modulation of feeding behavior to the regulation of energy homeostasis [8], cardiovascular function and bone formation [9].
This QRFP-GPR103 pair is remarkably conserved across various vertebrate species[10], highlighting its fundamental significance in biological systems.
GPR103 is not only pivotal in maintaining physiological balance but also presents therapeutic targets for disorders related to metabolism and appetite dysregulation.
For example, QRFP administration reportedly increased food intake and fat mass while reducing glucose-induced insulin release, and may also cause osteopenia and facilitate nociception [11].
Thus, the GPR103 antagonist demonstrated an anorexigenic effect in mice, and has been focused as a treatment for obesity.
Additionally, the GPR103 antagonist would be useful to trigger dormant state for survival treatment in emergency medical care.
Recent advancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have unveiled numerous GPCR-G-protein complex structures, including those associated with C-terminally amidated peptides such as cholecystokinin, orexin, and RY-amide neuropeptide Y[12–14].
These analyses have shed light on the intricacies of ligand-receptor interactions and their activation mechanisms.
Nevertheless, a notable gap remains in our understanding of RF-amide receptors, specifically GPR103.
The structures of these receptors have not been elucidated, leaving the mechanisms distinguishing RF- and RY-amides enigmatic.
This also includes an understanding of the selective activation of GPR103 by QRFP and the fundamental principles dictating ligand specificity among related receptors.
These gaps in structural data significantly hinder the strategic development of therapeutic agents targeting GPR103.
Here, we report a cryo-EM structure of the QRFP-bound GPR103•Gq complex, offering deep insights into its ligand recognition and selectivity, and dynamics.
