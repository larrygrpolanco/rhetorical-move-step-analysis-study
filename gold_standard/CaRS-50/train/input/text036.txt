Premature infants are born with underdeveloped lungs, which necessitates the use of supplemental oxygen to prevent mortality in these infants[1–6].
Supplemental oxygen prevents mortality but also leads to the development of retinal vascular abnormality-retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
Supplemental oxygen (hyperoxia) downregulates angiogenesis in phase I and causes vaso-obliteration, a precursor to phase II[6].
Every year, ROP claims the eyesight of nearly 30,000-40,000 prematurely born infants[7].
Multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated in the ROP and mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, including serine-one carbon, glutamine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, polyamine pathway, and fatty acid metabolism[6].
These metabolic changes in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model and the ROP indicate a biosynthetic deficit.
Proliferating endothelial cells have high biosynthetic demand to proliferate and migrate to develop new blood vessels.
Inhibition of endothelial cell (EC)-specific glutaminase (GLS) has been demonstrated to decrease proliferation and induce senescence in ECs[8, 9].
In addition, ablation of glutamine synthetase in Muller cells has been shown to cause EC proliferation defects[10].
This shows that glutamine production and utilization by the retina need to be balanced during angiogenesis.
Similarly, loss of serine transporter from the retina demonstrates aberrant angiogenesis in the retina[11].
In addition, polyamine pathway metabolites have also been shown to cause neovascular defects in the retinal and retinal cell types[12, 13].
These findings demonstrate that biosynthetic pathways are essential during angiogenesis.
Glycolysis and OXPHOS provide ATP necessary for cellular function; however, biosynthetic pathways like serine-one carbon, glutamine and polyamine pathways are necessary for the cells to divide.
At the cellular level, serine-one carbon metabolites are essential for glutathione production, NADPH synthesis, and Heme production pathways[2].
Serine-one carbon is the only source of methylation in the early developmental stages[14].
At the same time, glutamine is an essential nutrient for cellular proliferation[10].
Glutamine and downstream urea cycle metabolites arginine and ornithine also serve as precursors for polyamine pathway metabolites[15].
Glutamine is present in millimolar ranges, both in humans and mice, and because of its high abundance, it also serves as an alternative source of energy.
However, glutamine filling into TCA is bad for proliferating tissue as this lowers the amount available for biosynthetic reactions and produces ammonium, a toxic end product.
Carbon sources that can produce energy via the TCA cycle, other than glycolysis and glutaminolysis, are fatty acids and branched amino acids.
Newborns rely on fatty acids as their main energy source, as fats account for 40-50% of calories in the mother’s milk[16].
Free fatty acid also contributes to the majority of energy generation during fetal development[16].
During development, the fetus is supplied with free fatty acids from the maternal circulation.
Bitman et. al. have demonstrated that the fatty acid composition of the mother’s milk in premature and full-term infants differs in medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs)[17].
The highest amounts of MCFAs were observed in the mother’s milk of very preterm-born infants[16].
MCFAs are a very good energy source as they don’t need a carnitine-based transport to be oxidized, unlike required for long and very long chain fatty acids in many tissues, except for a few tissue types[18].
In addition, MCFAs are broken down by the action of lingual, milk, and gastric lipases and don’t need to rely on pancreatic lipase, which is low during the early stages of life[16].
This makes MCFAs a preferred energy source during the early stages of life.
The liver plays an important role in managing fatty acids in the body, both the production and the transport to different organs.
We have demonstrated that the liver-based HIF1α is important to produce serine-one carbon and remotely provide biosynthetic products to the retina[2].
In addition, signaling molecules like FGF21, a hepatokine, have been demonstrated to regulate physiological and pathological angiogenesis[19].
These findings demonstrate a system’s level of metabolic and biochemical signaling in retinal angiogenesis during the early stages of life.
Unlike genetic disorders, where the gene product of one or more pathways contributes to pathology, the ROP develops solely due to a change in oxygenation level in the environment to which the whole infant is exposed.
Although the whole body is exposed to hyperoxia, most of the studies are focused locally on the retina.
We used oxygen-induced retinopathy model to investigate systems-level liver-retina metabolic exchanges in response to hyperoxia.
This model recapitulates vaso-obliteration and neovascularization as seen in human disease ROP.
Ritter et al. have demonstrated that the BALB/cByJ strain is resistant to the OIR [20].
In this publication, we performed a multi-omics interorgan comparison of the OIR-resistant and OIR-susceptible strains of mice to find the genetic basis of protection.
