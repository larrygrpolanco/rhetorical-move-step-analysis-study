  - Regex-based tag extraction
  - Comprehensive error logging
  - Batch processing support
  - Detailed statistics
- **Output**: Standardized JSON matching gold standard format

### 3. **test_parser.py**
- **Purpose**: Validate parser on edge cases
- **Tests**: Perfect format, multi-tag, messy input, edge cases
- **Usage**: `python test_parser.py`

### 4. **METHODOLOGICAL_TRANSPARENCY.md**
- **Purpose**: Full documentation of what you changed and why
- **Sections**:
  - Study classification (methodological replication)
  - Prompt modifications (with justification)
  - What to say in your paper
  - Valid vs. invalid comparisons
  - Contribution statement

## 🎯 Your Study Classification

### **What This Is:**
**Methodological Replication with Adaptations**

You are testing whether Kim & Lu's **approach** (prompting strategies) transfers to:
- ✅ New domain (Biology)
- ✅ New framework (CaRS-50's 11 categories)
- ✅ Automated pipeline

### **What This Is NOT:**
- ❌ Perfect replication (too many changes)
- ❌ Direct numerical comparison (different frameworks)

### **Is This Publishable?**
**YES!** Here's why:

1. **Methodological science**: Testing transferability is valuable
2. **Transparent**: You document all changes clearly
3. **Rigorous**: Same evaluation metrics and statistics
4. **Practical**: Demonstrates real-world applicability

## 📊 What You Can Compare to Kim & Lu

### ✅ **Valid Comparisons:**

| Aspect | Your Study | Kim & Lu | Comparable? |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Move-level accuracy** | 3 moves | 3 moves | ✅ YES |
| **Methodological effectiveness** | Zero/few/fine-tune | Zero/few/fine-tune | ✅ YES |
| **Statistical tests** | McNemar's | McNemar's | ✅ YES |
| **Cost-benefit** | API costs | API costs | ✅ YES |
| **Error patterns** | Qualitative | Qualitative | ✅ YES |

### ❌ **Invalid Comparisons:**

| Aspect | Your Study | Kim & Lu | Comparable? |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Step-level accuracy** | 11 categories | 23 categories | ❌ NO |
| **Specific category performance** | CaRS-50 tags | K&L tags | ❌ NO |

## 🔬 Scientific vs. Sentimental?

### Your Question:
> "Is paying homage to the original scientific or sentimental?"

### Answer: **Both, and that's good science!**

**Scientific reasons to stay close to Kim & Lu:**
1. **Methodological continuity**: Easier to assess what changed
2. **Comparability**: Move-level results remain comparable
3. **Reproducibility**: Following established protocols
4. **Citation**: Proper attribution of methodology

**Sentimental reasons:**
1. **Respect**: Acknowledging pioneering work
2. **Community**: Building on shared knowledge
3. **Tradition**: Standing on shoulders of giants

**Bottom line**: Staying close to the original *while documenting changes* is best practice in replication science.

## 📝 What to Say in Your Paper

### **Abstract:**
> "Building on Kim & Lu's (2024) pioneering methodology, we conducted a methodological replication applying their prompting strategies to Biology research articles using the CaRS-50 framework."

### **Introduction:**
> "Kim & Lu (2024) demonstrated that ChatGPT can accurately annotate rhetorical moves in Applied Linguistics articles. However, two questions remain: (1) Do their findings generalize to other domains? (2) Does their approach work with simplified annotation schemes? We address these gaps by..."

### **Methods:**
> "We followed Kim & Lu's (2024) core methodology with three adaptations necessary for our context: (1) Biology domain instead of Applied Linguistics, (2) CaRS-50's 11-category framework instead of their 23-category framework, and (3) explicit output formatting to enable deterministic parsing. See Appendix A for full methodological comparison."

### **Discussion:**
> "Our results demonstrate that Kim & Lu's methodological approach transfers effectively across domains and framework granularities. While direct numerical comparison of step-level accuracy is not possible due to different category counts, the move-level results suggest..."

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Test the parser**: `python test_parser.py`
2. **Run pilot with new prompt**: Update `run_pilot.py` to use `a1_zero_shot_v2_parseable.txt`
3. **Parse outputs**: `python parse_llm_output.py`
4. **Compare to gold standard**: (We'll build the evaluation script next)

### After Pilot:
5. **Write Methods section**: Use METHODOLOGICAL_TRANSPARENCY.md as guide
6. **Build comparison table**: Move-level accuracy vs. Kim & Lu
7. **Discuss limitations**: Framework differences honestly

## 💡 Key Insight

**You are NOT replicating Kim & Lu's results.**

**You ARE validating their METHODOLOGY.**

This is:
- ✅ Scientifically valid
- ✅ Clearly claimable
- ✅ Publishable
- ✅ Transparent

**Frame it correctly, and you have a strong paper.**

## ❓ Addressing Your Concerns

### "I changed the prompt so much - what can I claim?"

**What you changed:**
- 4 lines of output format specification
- Domain (Biology)
- Framework (CaRS-50)

**What you DIDN'T change:**
- Conceptual framing
- Move/step definitions (adapted to CaRS-50)
- Annotation guidance
- Core evaluation methodology

**Claim**: "Methodological replication with necessary adaptations"

### "Is this still paying homage to the original?"

**YES!**
- You cite their work prominently
- You use their evaluation metrics
- You compare results (where valid)
- You acknowledge their pioneering contribution
- You document your changes transparently

**This is how good replication science works.**

## 📚 Summary

You have:
1. ✅ **Refined prompt** that enables deterministic parsing
2. ✅ **Robust parser** that handles real-world LLM outputs
3. ✅ **Clear methodology** documentation
4. ✅ **Honest framing** of your contribution
5. ✅ **Publishable** research design

**You're ready to run the pilot and see what happens!**

Test the parser first, then let's generate and parse some real LLM outputs.
