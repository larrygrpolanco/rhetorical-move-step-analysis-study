# Prompt Comparison: Original vs. Parseable

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### **Kim & Lu's Original Prompt Ending:**

```
**Instructions:**
You are going to be given one or a few paragraphs of the Introduction 
section of a research article in the field of Applied Linguistics. 
Break the given paragraph(s) into sentences and annotate each sentence 
using a tag in the framework above that describes the function of the 
sentence. Note that question marks could signal the boundary of sentences. 
Some sentences could be assigned multiple tags when they perform multiple 
functions. 

You will start your annotation with the given input text.
```

### **Your Adapted Prompt (a1_zero_shot.txt) Ending:**

```
**Instructions:**
You are going to be given one or more paragraphs from the Introduction 
section of a Biology research article. Break the given paragraph(s) into 
sentences and annotate each sentence using the tags from the framework above. 

Important notes:
- Question marks typically signal sentence boundaries
- Some sentences may perform multiple functions and should receive multiple tags
- Format your output as: [tag] sentence text
- For multiple tags, use: [tag1][tag2] sentence text

You will start your annotation with the given input text.
```

### **New Parseable Version (a1_zero_shot_v2_parseable.txt) Ending:**

```
**Instructions:**
You are going to be given one or more paragraphs from the Introduction 
section of a Biology research article. Break the given paragraph(s) into 
sentences and annotate each sentence using the tags from the framework above. 

Important notes:
- Question marks typically signal sentence boundaries
- Some sentences may perform multiple functions and should receive multiple tags
- Format your output as ONE tag and sentence per line                    [NEW]
- Use EXACTLY this format: [tag] sentence text                          [NEW]
- For multiple tags, use: [tag1][tag2] sentence text
- Do NOT add extra commentary, numbering, or explanation                [NEW]
- Begin each line with the tag(s) in square brackets                    [NEW]

Example output format:                                                   [NEW]
[1b] Photosynthesis is a fundamental process in plant biology.          [NEW]
[1c] Smith et al. (2020) demonstrated that light intensity affects      [NEW]
      chlorophyll production.                                            [NEW]
[2b] However, the mechanisms in aquatic plants remain poorly understood. [NEW]

You will start your annotation with the given input text.

## Changes Summary

### From Kim & Lu → Your Initial Adaptation:
1. "Applied Linguistics" → "Biology"
2. Framework: 23 categories → 11 categories (CaRS-50)
3. Added explicit format example: `[tag] sentence text`

### From Your Initial → Parseable Version:
Added 4 new constraints + example:

| Line | Purpose | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| "Format your output as ONE tag and sentence per line" | Prevent multi-line ambiguity | Parsing |
| "Use EXACTLY this format: [tag] sentence text" | Emphasize strict format | Parsing |
| "Do NOT add extra commentary..." | Prevent preamble/postamble | Parsing |
| "Begin each line with the tag(s)..." | Clear line-start requirement | Parsing |
| Example output block | Show concrete format | Clarity |

**Total new text: 8 lines (7 instruction + 1 blank)**

**Total semantic content change: 0** (all changes are structural)

---

## Justification for Changes

### Problem:
LLMs without explicit format constraints often produce:
- Preambles: "Here is my annotation:"
- Numbering: "1. [1a] First sentence"
- Commentary: "Note: This is Move 1"
- Inconsistent spacing: Sometimes `[tag]text`, sometimes `[tag] text`

### Solution:
Minimal format specification that:
1. Preserves Kim & Lu's semantic instructions
2. Adds structural constraints for deterministic parsing
3. Provides concrete example
4. Forbids extra content

### Precedent:
Kim & Lu likely handled parsing manually or with custom scripts. 
For reproducible automation, explicit format is necessary.

## What We DIDN'T Change

✅ **Preserved from Kim & Lu:**
- Genre analysis conceptual framing
- Move-step definitions (adapted to CaRS-50)
- Examples for each category
- Multi-tag guidance
- Sentence boundary guidance
- Annotation decision logic

❌ **What we added:**
- Output format structure only

---

## Scientific Impact

### On Annotation Quality:
- **No expected impact**: Format constraints don't affect semantic decisions
- **Possible benefit**: Explicit structure may reduce model confusion

### On Comparability:
- **Move-level**: Fully comparable to Kim & Lu
- **Step-level**: Not comparable (different frameworks)
- **Methodology**: Comparable (same approach, explicit format)

### On Reproducibility:
- **Major benefit**: Fully deterministic parsing
- **Transparency**: Changes are documented
- **Replication**: Others can reproduce exactly

## How to Report This in Your Paper

### Option 1: Brief (in main methods)

> We adapted Kim & Lu's (2024) prompt for the CaRS-50 framework and 
> Biology domain. To enable deterministic parsing, we added explicit 
> format instructions specifying that each line should begin with tags 
> in square brackets (e.g., "[1a] sentence text"). These structural 
> constraints do not affect annotation decisions but ensure consistent 
> output format. See Supplementary Materials for full prompt comparison.

### Option 2: Detailed (in supplementary materials)

> **Prompt Modifications**
>
> We made two adaptations to Kim & Lu's (2024) prompt:
>
> 1. **Framework and Domain**: We replaced their 23-category framework 
>    with CaRS-50's 11 categories and changed the domain from Applied 
>    Linguistics to Biology.
>
> 2. **Output Format Specification**: We added four explicit format 
>    constraints (e.g., "Format your output as ONE tag and sentence per 
>    line") and a three-line example. These additions enable deterministic 
>    parsing without affecting annotation logic. The core instructional 
>    content—move/step definitions, examples, and decision guidance—remains 
>    conceptually identical to Kim & Lu's approach.
>
> [Include full prompts in appendix]

### Option 3: Transparent (for methods-focused journals)

> **Methodological Note on Prompt Engineering**
>
> Kim & Lu (2024) did not specify their output parsing strategy. Given 
> that LLMs can produce inconsistent formatting without explicit 
> constraints, we added minimal format specification to their prompt 
> (four lines specifying structure and a three-line example). This 
> modification enables fully reproducible, deterministic parsing while 
> preserving the semantic content of their instructions. We provide 
> both versions in our repository for comparison.

## Key Takeaway

**You changed OUTPUT STRUCTURE, not ANNOTATION LOGIC.**

This is:
- ✅ Methodologically sound
- ✅ Transparently documented  
- ✅ Scientifically justified
- ✅ Minimally invasive

**It's an implementation detail, not a conceptual change.**

Frame it that way, and you're golden.
